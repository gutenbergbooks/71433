  iii. _Agros iungit agris cupidus domibusque domosque,_
         _Possideat totam sic quasi solus humum._
       _Solus et innumeros mulierum spirat amores,_
         _Vt sacra millenis sit sibi culta Venus._[1]

    Dame Avarice is noght soleine,
  Which is of gold the Capiteine;
  Bot of hir Court in sondri wise[2]
  After the Scole of hire aprise
      [Sidenote: Hic tractat confessor super illa specie
      Auaricie, que Cupiditas[3] dicitur, quam in amoris causa
      pertractans Amanti super hoc opponit.]
  Sche hath of Servantz manyon,
  Wherof that Covoitise is on;
  Which goth the large world aboute,
  To seche thavantages oute,[4]
  Wher that he mai the profit winne[5]
  To Avarice, and bringth it inne.                                1980
  That on hald and that other draweth,[6]
  Ther is no day which hem bedaweth,
  No mor the Sonne than the Mone,
  Whan ther is eny thing to done,
  And namely with Covoitise;
  For he stant out of al assisse
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 194=]
  Of resonable mannes fare.
  Wher he pourposeth him to fare[7]
  Upon his lucre and his beyete,
  The smale path, the large Strete,                               1990
  The furlong and the longe Mile,
  Al is bot on for thilke while:[8]
  And for that he is such on holde,
  Dame Avarice him hath withholde,
  As he which is the principal
  Outward, for he is overal
  A pourveour and an aspie.
  For riht as of an hungri Pie
  The storve bestes ben awaited,
  Riht so is Covoitise afaited                                    2000
  To loke where he mai pourchace,
  For be his wille he wolde embrace[9]
  Al that this wyde world beclippeth;
  Bot evere he somwhat overhippeth,
  That he ne mai noght al fulfille
  The lustes of his gredi wille.
  Bot where it falleth in a lond,
  That Covoitise in myhti hond
  Is set, it is ful hard to fiede;
  For thanne he takth non other hiede,                            2010
  Bot that he mai pourchace and gete,
  His conscience hath al foryete,
  And not what thing it mai amonte
  That he schal afterward acompte.
  Bote as the Luce in his degre
  Of tho that lasse ben than he
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 195=]
  The fisshes griedeli devoureth,
  So that no water hem socoureth,
  Riht so no lawe mai rescowe
  Fro him that wol no riht allowe;[10]                            2020
  For wher that such on is of myht,
  His will schal stonde in stede of riht.
  Thus be the men destruid fulofte,
  Til that the grete god alofte
  Ayein so gret a covoitise
  Redresce it in his oghne wise:
  And in ensample of alle tho
  I finde a tale write so,
  The which, for it is good to liere,
  Hierafterward thou schalt it hiere.[11]                         2030

                                [Sidenote: [TALE OF VIRGIL’S MIRROR.]]
    Whan Rome stod in noble plit,
  Virgile, which was tho parfit,
      [Sidenote: Hic ponit exemplum contra magnates cupidos. Et
      narrat de Crasso Romanorum Imperatore, qui turrim, in qua
      speculum Virgilii Rome fixum extiterat, dolosa circumuentus
      cupiditate euertit; vnde non solum sui ipsius perdicionem,
      set tocius Ciuitatis intollerabile dampnum contingere
      causauit.]
  A Mirour made of his clergie
  And sette it in the tounes ÿe
  Of marbre on a piler withoute;
  That thei be thritty Mile aboute
  Be daie and ek also be nyhte
  In that Mirour beholde myhte
  Here enemys, if eny were,
  With al here ordinance there,                                   2040
  Which thei ayein the Cite caste:
  So that, whil thilke Mirour laste,
  Ther was no lond which mihte achieve
  With werre Rome forto grieve;
  Wherof was gret envie tho.
  And fell that ilke time so,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 196=]
  That Rome hadde werres stronge
  Ayein Cartage, and stoden longe
  The tuo Cites upon debat.
  Cartage sih the stronge astat[12]                               2050
  Of Rome in thilke Mirour stonde,
  And thoghte al prively to fonde
  To overthrowe it be som wyle.
  And Hanybal was thilke while
  The Prince and ledere of Cartage,
  Which hadde set al his corage
  Upon knihthod in such a wise,[13]
  That he be worthi and be wise
  And be non othre was conseiled,[14]
  Wherof the world is yit merveiled                               2060
  Of the maistries that he wroghte
  Upon the marches whiche he soghte.
  And fell in thilke time also,
  The king of Puile, which was tho,
  Thoghte ayein Rome to rebelle,
  And thus was take the querele,
  Hou to destruie this Mirour.
    Of Rome tho was Emperour[15]
  Crassus, which was so coveitous,
  That he was evere desirous                                      2070
  Of gold to gete the pilage;
  Wherof that Puile and ek Cartage
  With Philosophres wise and grete
  Begunne of this matiere trete,[16]
  And ate laste in this degre
  Ther weren Philosophres thre,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 197=]
  To do this thing whiche undertoke,
  And therupon thei with hem toke
  A gret tresor of gold in cophres,[17]
  To Rome and thus these philisophres                             2080
  Togedre in compainie wente,
  Bot noman wiste what thei mente.
  Whan thei to Rome come were,
  So prively thei duelte there,
  As thei that thoghten to deceive:
  Was non that mihte of hem perceive,
  Til thei in sondri stedes have
  Here gold under the ground begrave
  In tuo tresors, that to beholde
  Thei scholden seme as thei were olde.                           2090
  And so forth thanne upon a day
  Al openly in good arai
  To themperour thei hem presente,
  And tolden it was here entente
  To duellen under his servise.
  And he hem axeth in what wise;
  And thei him tolde in such a plit,
  That ech of hem hadde a spirit,[18]
  The which slepende a nyht appiereth
  And hem be sondri dremes lereth                                 2100
  After the world that hath betid.
  Under the ground if oght be hid
  Of old tresor at eny throwe,
  They schull it in here swevenes knowe;
  And upon this condicioun,
  Thei sein, what gold under the toun
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 198=]
  Of Rome is hid, thei wole it finde,
  Ther scholde noght be left behinde,[19]
  Be so that he the halvendel
  Hem grante, and he assenteth wel;                               2110
  And thus cam sleighte forto duelle
  With Covoitise, as I thee telle.
  This Emperour bad redily
  That thei be logged faste by[20]
  Where he his oghne body lay;
  And whan it was amorwe day,
  That on of hem seith that he mette
  Wher he a goldhord scholde fette:
  Wherof this Emperour was glad,
  And therupon anon he bad                                        2120
  His Mynours forto go and myne,
  And he himself of that covine
  Goth forth withal, and at his hond
  The tresor redi there he fond,
  Where as thei seide it scholde be;
  And who was thanne glad bot he?
    Upon that other dai secounde
  Thei have an other goldhord founde,
  Which the seconde maister tok
  Upon his swevene and undertok.                                  2130
  And thus the sothe experience
  To themperour yaf such credence,
  That al his trist and al his feith
  So sikerliche on hem he leith,
  Of that he fond him so relieved,
  That thei ben parfitli believed,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 199=]
  As thogh thei were goddes thre.
  Nou herkne the soutilete.
    The thridde maister scholde mete,
  Which, as thei seiden, was unmete                               2140
  Above hem alle, and couthe most;
  And he withoute noise or bost
  Al priveli, so as he wolde,
  Upon the morwe his swevene tolde
  To themperour riht in his Ere,
  And seide him that he wiste where
  A tresor was so plentivous
  Of gold and ek so precious
  Of jeueals and of riche stones,
  That unto alle hise hors at ones[21]                            2150
  It were a charge sufficant.
  This lord upon this covenant
  Was glad, and axeth where it was.
  The maister seide, under the glas,
  And tolde him eke, as for the Myn
  He wolde ordeigne such engin,
  That thei the werk schull undersette[22]
  With Tymber, that withoute lette
  Men mai the tresor saufli delve,
  So that the Mirour be himselve                                  2160
  Withoute empeirement schal stonde:
  And this the maister upon honde[23]
  Hath undertake in alle weie.
  This lord, which hadde his wit aweie
  And was with Covoitise blent,
  Anon therto yaf his assent;
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 200=]
  And thus they myne forth withal,
  The timber set up overal,
  Wherof the Piler stod upriht;
  Til it befell upon a nyht                                       2170
  These clerkes, whan thei were war
  Hou that the timber only bar
  The Piler, wher the Mirour stod,--
  Here sleihte noman understod,--
  Thei go be nyhte unto the Myne
  With pich, with soulphre and with rosine,
  And whan the Cite was a slepe,[24]
  A wylde fyr into the depe
  They caste among the timberwerk,
  And so forth, whil the nyht was derk,                           2180
  Desguised in a povere arai
  Thei passeden the toun er dai.
  And whan thei come upon an hell,
  Thei sihen how the Mirour fell,
  Wherof thei maden joie ynowh,
  And ech of hem with other lowh,
  And seiden, ‘Lo, what coveitise
  Mai do with hem that be noght wise!’
  And that was proved afterward,
  For every lond, to Romeward                                     2190
  Which hadde be soubgit tofore,
  Whan this Mirour was so forlore
  And thei the wonder herde seie,
  Anon begunne desobeie
  With werres upon every side;
  And thus hath Rome lost his pride
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 201=]
  And was defouled overal.
  For this I finde of Hanybal,
  That he of Romeins in a dai,
  Whan he hem fond out of arai,                                   2200
  So gret a multitude slowh,
  That of goldringes, whiche he drowh[25]
  Of gentil handes that ben dede,
  Buisshelles fulle thre, I rede,
  He felde, and made a bregge also,
  That he mihte over Tibre go
  Upon the corps that dede were
  Of the Romeins, whiche he slowh there.[26]
    Bot now to speke of the juise,
  The which after the covoitise                                   2210
  Was take upon this Emperour,
  For he destruide the Mirour;
  It is a wonder forto hiere.
  The Romeins maden a chaiere
  And sette here Emperour therinne,
  And seiden, for he wolde winne
  Of gold the superfluite,
  Of gold he scholde such plente
  Receive, til he seide Ho:
  And with gold, which thei hadden tho                            2220
  Buillende hot withinne a panne,
  Into his Mouth thei poure thanne.
  And thus the thurst of gold was queynt,
                                              [Sidenote: [COVEITISE.]]
  With gold which hadde ben atteignt.
                                                [Sidenote: Confessor.]
    Wherof, mi Sone, thou miht hiere,
  Whan Covoitise hath lost the stiere[27]
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 202=]
  Of resonable governance,
  Ther falleth ofte gret vengance.
  For ther mai be no worse thing
  Than Covoitise aboute a king:                                   2230
  If it in his persone be,
  It doth the more adversite;
  And if it in his conseil stonde,
  It bringth alday meschief to honde
  Of commun harm; and if it growe
  Withinne his court, it wol be knowe,
  For thanne schal the king be piled.
  The man which hath hise londes tiled,
  Awaiteth noght more redily
  The Hervest, than thei gredily                                  2240
  Ne maken thanne warde and wacche,
  Wher thei the profit mihten cacche:
  And yit fulofte it falleth so,
  As men mai sen among hem tho,
  That he which most coveiteth faste
  Hath lest avantage ate laste.
  For whan fortune is therayein,
  Thogh he coveite, it is in vein;
  The happes be noght alle liche,
  On is mad povere, an other riche,                               2250
  The court to some doth profit,
  And some ben evere in o plit;
  And yit thei bothe aliche sore
  Coveite, bot fortune is more
  Unto that o part favorable.
  And thogh it be noght resonable,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 203=]
  This thing a man mai sen alday,
  Wherof that I thee telle may
  A fair ensample in remembrance,
  Hou every man mot take his chance                               2260
  Or of richesse or of poverte.
  Hou so it stonde of the decerte,
  Hier is noght every thing aquit,
  For ofte a man mai se this yit,
  That who best doth, lest thonk schal have;
  It helpeth noght the world to crave,
  Which out of reule and of mesure
  Hath evere stonde in aventure
  Als wel in Court as elles where:
  And hou in olde daies there                                     2270
  It stod, so as the thinges felle,
  I thenke a tale forto telle.

                                [Sidenote: [TALE OF THE TWO COFFERS.]]
    In a Cronique this I rede.
  Aboute a king, as moste nede,
      [Sidenote: Hic ponit Confessor exemplum contra illos, qui
      in domibus Regum seruientes, pro eo quod ipsi secundum
      eorum cupiditatem promoti non existunt, de regio seruicio

  Ther was of knyhtes and squiers
  Gret route, and ek of Officers:
  Some of long time him hadden served,
  And thoghten that thei have deserved
  Avancement, and gon withoute;
  And some also ben of the route                                  2280
  That comen bat a while agon,
  And thei avanced were anon.
  These olde men upon this thing,
  So as thei dorste, ayein the king
  Among hemself compleignen ofte:
  Bot ther is nothing seid so softe,

  And natheles the king hath bede

  As he that was of wisdom slih,
  Whan he therto his time sih,
  Al prively, that non it wiste,

  So it betidde upon a throwe
  This lord fell into gret seknesse:
  Phisique hath don the besinesse
  Of sondri cures manyon
  To make him hol; and therupon
  A worthi maister which ther was
  Yaf him conseil upon this cas,[65]
  That if he wolde have parfit hele,
  He scholde with a womman dele,                                  2660
  A freissh, a yong, a lusti wiht,
  To don him compaignie a nyht;
  For thanne he seide him redily,
  That he schal be al hol therby,
  And otherwise he kneu no cure.
    This king, which stod in aventure[66]
  Of lif and deth, for medicine
  Assented was, and of covine
  His Steward, whom he tristeth wel,
  He tok, and tolde him everydel,                                 2670
  Hou that this maister hadde seid:[67]
  And therupon he hath him preid
  And charged upon his ligance,
  That he do make porveance

  What coveitise in love doth.

  With hire he yaf in mariage,
  That only for thilke avantage[71]

  For lucre and noght for loves sake,[72]
  And that was afterward wel seene;

    This Steward in his oghne herte
  Sih that his lord mai noght asterte                             2700
  His maladie, bot he have
  A lusti womman him to save,
  And thoghte he wolde yive ynowh
  Of his tresor; wherof he drowh
  Gret coveitise into his mynde,
  And sette his honour fer behynde.
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 218=]
  Thus he, whom gold hath overset,
  Was trapped in his oghne net;
  The gold hath mad hise wittes lame,
  So that sechende his oghne schame                               2710
  He rouneth in the kinges Ere,
  And seide him that he wiste where
  A gentile and a lusti on
  Tho was, and thider wolde he gon:[73]
  Bot he mot yive yiftes grete;
  For bot it be thurgh gret beyete
  Of gold, he seith, he schal noght spede.
  The king him bad upon the nede
  That take an hundred pound he scholde,
  And yive it where that he wolde,                                2720
  Be so it were in worthi place:
  And thus to stonde in loves grace
  This king his gold hath abandouned.
  And whan this tale was full rouned,
  The Steward tok the gold and wente,
  Withinne his herte and many a wente
  Of coveitise thanne he caste,
  Wherof a pourpos ate laste
  Ayein love and ayein his riht
  He tok, and seide hou thilke nyht                               2730
  His wif schal ligge be the king;
  And goth thenkende upon this thing
  Toward his In, til he cam hom
  Into the chambre, and thanne he nom
  His wif, and tolde hire al the cas.[74]
  And sche, which red for schame was,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 219=]
  With bothe hire handes hath him preid[75]
  Knelende and in this wise seid,[76]
  That sche to reson and to skile
  In what thing that he bidde wile[77]                            2740
  Is redy forto don his heste,
  Bot this thing were noght honeste,
  That he for gold hire scholde selle.
  And he tho with hise wordes felle
  Forth with his gastly contienance
  Seith that sche schal don obeissance
  And folwe his will in every place;
  And thus thurgh strengthe of his manace
  Hir innocence is overlad,
  Wherof sche was so sore adrad                                   2750
  That sche his will mot nede obeie.
  And therupon was schape a weie,[78]
  That he his oghne wif be nyhte
  Hath out of alle mennes sihte
  So prively that non it wiste
  Broght to the king, which as him liste
  Mai do with hire what he wolde.
  For whan sche was ther as sche scholde,
  With him abedde under the cloth,
  The Steward tok his leve and goth                               2760
  Into a chambre faste by;[79]
  Bot hou he slep, that wot noght I,
  For he sih cause of jelousie.
    Bot he, which hath the compainie
  Of such a lusti on as sche,
  Him thoghte that of his degre
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 220=]
  Ther was noman so wel at ese:
  Sche doth al that sche mai to plese,
  So that his herte al hol sche hadde;
  And thus this king his joie ladde,                              2770
  Til it was nyh upon the day.[80]
  The Steward thanne wher sche lay
  Cam to the bedd, and in his wise[81]
  Hath bede that sche scholde arise.
  The king seith, ‘Nay, sche schal noght go.’
  His Steward seide ayein, ‘Noght so;[82]
  For sche mot gon er it be knowe,
  And so I swor at thilke throwe,
  Whan I hire fette to you hiere.’[83]
  The king his tale wol noght hiere,[84]                          2780
  And seith hou that he hath hire boght,
  Forthi sche schal departe noght,
  Til he the brighte dai beholde.
  And cawhte hire in hise armes folde,
  As he which liste forto pleie,
  And bad his Steward gon his weie,
  And so he dede ayein his wille.
  And thus his wif abedde stille
  Lay with the king the longe nyht,
  Til that it was hih Sonne lyht;                                 2790
  Bot who sche was he knew nothing.
    Tho cam the Steward to the king
  And preide him that withoute schame[85]
  In savinge of hire goode name
  He myhte leden hom ayein
  This lady, and hath told him plein
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 221=]
  Hou that it was his oghne wif.
  The king his Ere unto this strif
  Hath leid, and whan that he it herde,
  Welnyh out of his wit he ferde,                                 2800
  And seide, ‘Ha, caitif most of alle,
  Wher was it evere er this befalle,
  That eny cokard in this wise
  Betok his wif for coveitise?
  Thou hast bothe hire and me beguiled
  And ek thin oghne astat reviled,
  Wherof that buxom unto thee
  Hierafter schal sche nevere be.
  For this avou to god I make,
  After this day if I thee take,                                  2810
  Thou schalt ben honged and todrawe.
  Nou loke anon thou be withdrawe,
  So that I se thee neveremore.’
  This Steward thanne dradde him sore,
  With al the haste that he mai
  And fledde awei that same dai,[86]
  And was exiled out of londe.
    Lo, there a nyce housebonde,
  Which thus hath lost his wif for evere!
  Bot natheles sche hadde a levere;                               2820
  The king hire weddeth and honoureth,
  Wherof hire name sche socoureth,
  Which erst was lost thurgh coveitise
  Of him, that ladde hire other wise,
  And hath himself also forlore.

  So longe his wit aboute he caste,
  Til that he fond out ate laste,
  Bot if they hadden Achilles
  Here werre schal ben endeles.
  And over that he tolde hem plein
  In what manere he was besein,
  And in what place he schal be founde;
  So that withinne a litel stounde
  Ulixes forth with Diomede
  Upon this point to Lichomede                                    3100
  Agamenon togedre sente.
  Bot Ulixes, er he forth wente,
  Which was on of the moste wise,
  Ordeigned hath in such a wise,
  That he the moste riche aray,
  Wherof a womman mai be gay,
  With him hath take manyfold,
  And overmore, as it is told,
  An harneis for a lusti kniht,
  Which burned was as Selver bryht,[120]                          3110
  Of swerd, of plate and ek of maile,
  As thogh he scholde to bataille,
  He tok also with him be Schipe.
  And thus togedre in felaschipe
  Forth gon this Diomede and he
  In hope til thei mihten se
  The place where Achilles is.
    The wynd stod thanne noght amis,
  Bot evene topseilcole it blew,[121]
  Til Ulixes the Marche knew,                                     3120

  Wher Lichomede his Regne hadde.
  The Stieresman so wel hem ladde,
  That thei ben comen sauf to londe,
  Wher thei gon out upon the stronde
  Into the Burgh, wher that thei founde
  The king, and he which hath facounde,
  Ulixes, dede the message.
  Bot the conseil of his corage,
  Why that he cam, he tolde noght,
  Bot undernethe he was bethoght                                  3130
  In what manere he mihte aspie
  Achilles fro Deïdamie
  And fro these othre that ther were,
  Full many a lusti ladi there.
    Thei pleide hem there a day or tuo,
  And as it was fortuned so,
  It fell that time in such a wise,
  To Bachus that a sacrifise
  Thes yonge ladys scholden make;
  And for the strange mennes sake,                                3140
  That comen fro the Siege of Troie,
  Thei maden wel the more joie.
  Ther was Revel, ther was daunsinge,
  And every lif which coude singe
  Of lusti wommen in the route[122]
  A freissh carole hath sunge aboute;
  Bot for al this yit natheles
  The Greks unknowe of Achilles
  So weren, that in no degre
  Thei couden wite which was he,                                  3150
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 233=]
  Ne be his vois, ne be his pas.
  Ulixes thanne upon this cas[123]
  A thing of hih Prudence hath wroght:
  For thilke aray, which he hath broght
  To yive among the wommen there,
  He let do fetten al the gere
  Forth with a knihtes harneis eke,--
  In al a contre forto seke[124]
  Men scholden noght a fairer se,--
  And every thing in his degre                                    3160
  Endlong upon a bord he leide.
  To Lichomede and thanne he preide
  That every ladi chese scholde
  What thing of alle that sche wolde,
  And take it as be weie of yifte;
  For thei hemself it scholde schifte,
  He seide, after here oghne wille.
    Achilles thanne stod noght stille:
  Whan he the bryhte helm behield,[125]
  The swerd, the hauberk and the Schield,                         3170
  His herte fell therto anon;
  Of all that othre wolde he non,
  The knihtes gere he underfongeth,
  And thilke aray which that belongeth
  Unto the wommen he forsok.
  And in this wise, as seith the bok,
  Thei knowen thanne which he was:
  For he goth forth the grete pas
  Into the chambre where he lay;
  Anon, and made no delay,                                        3180
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 234=]
  He armeth him in knyhtli wise,
  That bettre can noman devise,
  And as fortune scholde falle,
  He cam so forth tofore hem alle,
  As he which tho was glad ynowh.
  But Lichomede nothing lowh,
  Whan that he syh hou that it ferde,
  For thanne he wiste wel and herde,
  His dowhter hadde be forlein;
  Bot that he was so oversein,                                    3190
  The wonder overgoth his wit.
  For in Cronique is write yit[126]
  Thing which schal nevere be foryete,
  Hou that Achilles hath begete
  Pirrus upon Deïdamie,
  Wherof cam out the tricherie
  Of Falswitnesse, whan thei saide[127]
  Hou that Achilles was a Maide.
  Bot that was nothing sene tho,
  For he is to the Siege go                                       3200
  Forth with Ulixe and Diomede.

  Which stant yet of Auctorite
  In tokne and in memorial;
  Wherof the tale in special
  Is in the bok of Troie write,
  Which I schal do thee forto wite.[134]

    In Grece whilom was a king,
  Of whom the fame and knowleching
                                [Sidenote: [TALE OF JASON AND MEDEA.]]
  Beleveth yit, and Peleüs
  He hihte; bot it fell him thus,                                 3250
      [Sidenote: Hic in amoris causa ponit exemplum contra

  That his fortune hir whiel so ladde
  That he no child his oghne hadde
  To regnen after his decess.
  He hadde a brother natheles,
  Whos rihte name was Eson,
  And he the worthi kniht Jason
  Begat, the which in every lond
  Alle othre passede of his hond
  In Armes, so that he the beste
  Was named and the worthieste,                                   3260
  He soghte worschipe overal.
  Nou herkne, and I thee telle schal
  An aventure that he soghte,
  Which afterward ful dere he boghte.
    Ther was an yle, which Colchos
  Was cleped, and therof aros
  Gret speche in every lond aboute,
  That such merveile was non oute
  In al the wyde world nawhere,
  As tho was in that yle there.                                   3270
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 237=]
  Ther was a Schiep, as it was told,
  The which his flees bar al of gold,
  And so the goddes hadde it set,
  That it ne mihte awei be fet
  Be pouer of no worldes wiht:
  And yit ful many a worthi kniht
  It hadde assaied, as thei dorste,
  And evere it fell hem to the worste.
  Bot he, that wolde it noght forsake,
  Bot of his knyhthod undertake                                   3280
  To do what thing therto belongeth,[136]
  This worthi Jason, sore alongeth
  To se the strange regiouns
  And knowe the condiciouns
  Of othre Marches, where he wente;
  And for that cause his hole entente
  He sette Colchos forto seche,
  And therupon he made a speche
  To Peleüs his Em the king.
  And he wel paid was of that thing;[137]                         3290
  And schop anon for his passage,
  And suche as were of his lignage,
  With othre knihtes whiche he ches,
  With him he tok, and Hercules,
  Which full was of chivalerie,[138]
  With Jason wente in compaignie;
  And that was in the Monthe of Maii,
  Whan colde stormes were away.
  The wynd was good, the Schip was yare,
  Thei tok here leve, and forth thei fare[139]                    3300
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 238=]
  Toward Colchos: bot on the weie
  What hem befell is long to seie;
  Hou Lamedon the king of Troie,
  Which oghte wel have mad hem joie,[140]
  Whan thei to reste a while him preide,
  Out of his lond he hem congeide;[141]
  And so fell the dissencion,
  Which after was destruccion
  Of that Cite, as men mai hiere:
  Bot that is noght to mi matiere.                                3310
  Bot thus this[142] worthi folk Gregeis[143]
  Fro that king, which was noght curteis,
  And fro his lond with Sail updrawe
  Thei wente hem forth, and many a sawe
  Thei made and many a gret manace,
  Til ate laste into that place
  Which as thei soghte thei aryve,
  And striken Sail, and forth as blyve
  Thei sente unto the king and tolden
  Who weren ther and what thei wolden.                            3320
  Oëtes, which was thanne king,[144]
  Whan that he herde this tyding
  Of Jason, which was comen there,
  And of these othre, what thei were,
  He thoghte don hem gret worschipe:
  For thei anon come out of Schipe,
  And strawht unto the king thei wente,
  And be the hond Jason he hente,
  And that was ate paleis gate,
  So fer the king cam on his gate                                 3330
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 239=]
  Toward Jason to don him chiere;
  And he, whom lacketh no manere,
  Whan he the king sih in presence,
  Yaf him ayein such reverence
  As to a kinges stat belongeth.
  And thus the king him underfongeth,
  And Jason in his arm he cawhte,
  And forth into the halle he strawhte,
  And ther they siete and spieke of thinges,
  And Jason tolde him tho tidinges,[145]                          3340
  Why he was come, and faire him preide
  To haste his time, and the kyng seide,
  ‘Jason, thou art a worthi kniht,
  Bot it lith in no mannes myht
  To don that thou art come fore:
  Ther hath be many a kniht forlore
  Of that thei wolden it assaie.’
  Bot Jason wolde him noght esmaie,
  And seide, ‘Of every worldes cure
  Fortune stant in aventure,                                      3350
  Per aunter wel, per aunter wo:
  Bot hou as evere that it go,
  It schal be with myn hond assaied.’
  The king tho hield him noght wel paied,
  For he the Grekes sore dredde,
  In aunter, if Jason ne spedde,
  He mihte therof bere a blame;
  For tho was al the worldes fame
  In Grece, as forto speke of Armes.
  Forthi he dredde him of his harmes,                             3360
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 240=]
  And gan to preche him and to preie;
  Bot Jason wolde noght obeie,
  Bot seide he wolde his porpos holde
  For ought that eny man him tolde.
  The king, whan he thes wordes herde,[146]
  And sih hou that this kniht ansuerde,
  Yit for he wolde make him glad,
  After Medea gon he bad,
  Which was his dowhter, and sche cam.
  And Jason, which good hiede nam,                                3370
  Whan he hire sih, ayein hire goth;
  And sche, which was him nothing loth,
  Welcomede him into that lond,
  And softe tok him be the hond,
  And doun thei seten bothe same.
  Sche hadde herd spoke of his name[147]
  And of his grete worthinesse;
  Forthi sche gan hir yhe impresse
  Upon his face and his stature,
  And thoghte hou nevere creature                                 3380
  Was so wel farende as was he.
  And Jason riht in such degre
  Ne mihte noght withholde his lok,
  Bot so good hiede on hire he tok,
  That him ne thoghte under the hevene
  Of beaute sawh he nevere hir evene,
  With al that fell to wommanhiede.
  Thus ech of other token hiede,
  Thogh ther no word was of record;
  Here hertes bothe of on acord                                   3390
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 241=]
  Ben set to love, bot as tho
  Ther mihten be no wordes mo.
  The king made him gret joie and feste,[148]
  To alle his men he yaf an heste,
  So as thei wolde his thonk deserve,
  That thei scholde alle Jason serve,
  Whil that he wolde there duelle.
  And thus the dai, schortly to telle,
  With manye merthes thei despente,
  Til nyht was come, and tho thei wente,                          3400
  Echon of other tok his leve,
  Whan thei no lengere myhten leve.
  I not hou Jason that nyht slep,
  Bot wel I wot that of the Schep,
  For which he cam into that yle,
  He thoghte bot a litel whyle;
  Al was Medea that he thoghte,
  So that in many a wise he soghte
  His witt wakende er it was day,
  Som time yee, som time nay,                                     3410
  Som time thus, som time so,
  As he was stered to and fro
  Of love, and ek of his conqueste
  As he was holde of his beheste.
  And thus he ros up be the morwe
  And tok himself seint John to borwe,
  And seide he wolde ferst beginne
  At love, and after forto winne
  The flees of gold, for which he com,
  And thus to him good herte he nom.                              3420
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 242=]
    Medea riht the same wise,
  Til dai cam that sche moste arise,[149]
  Lay and bethoughte hire al the nyht,
  Hou sche that noble worthi kniht
  Be eny weie mihte wedde:
  And wel sche wiste, if he ne spedde
  Of thing which he hadde undertake,
  Sche mihte hirself no porpos take;
  For if he deide of his bataile,
  Sche moste thanne algate faile                                  3430
  To geten him, whan he were ded.
  Thus sche began to sette red
  And torne aboute hir wittes alle,
  To loke hou that it mihte falle
  That sche with him hadde a leisir
  To speke and telle of hir desir.
  And so it fell that same day[150]
  That Jason with that suete may
  Togedre sete and hadden space
  To speke, and he besoughte hir grace.[151]                      3440
  And sche his tale goodli herde,
  And afterward sche him ansuerde
  And seide, ‘Jason, as thou wilt,
  Thou miht be sauf, thou miht be spilt;
  For wite wel that nevere man,
  Bot if he couthe that I can,
  Ne mihte that fortune achieve
  For which thou comst: bot as I lieve,
  If thou wolt holde covenant
  To love, of al the remenant                                     3450
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 243=]
  I schal thi lif and honour save,
  That thou the flees of gold schalt have.’
  He seide, ‘Al at youre oghne wille,
  Ma dame, I schal treuly fulfille
  Youre heste, whil mi lif mai laste.’
  Thus longe he preide, and ate laste
  Sche granteth, and behihte him this,
  That whan nyht comth and it time is,
  Sche wolde him sende certeinly
  Such on that scholde him prively                                3460
  Al one into hire chambre bringe.
  He thonketh hire of that tidinge,
  For of that grace him is begonne
  Him thenkth alle othre thinges wonne.
    The dai made ende and lost his lyht,[152]
  And comen was the derke nyht,
  Which al the daies yhe blente.
  Jason tok leve and forth he wente,
  And whan he cam out of the pres,
  He tok to conseil Hercules,                                     3470
  And tolde him hou it was betid,
  And preide it scholde wel ben hid,[153]
  And that he wolde loke aboute,
  Therwhiles that he schal ben oute.
  Thus as he stod and hiede nam,
  A Mayden fro Medea cam
  And to hir chambre Jason ledde,
  Wher that he fond redi to bedde
  The faireste and the wiseste eke;
  And sche with simple chiere and meke,                           3480
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 244=]
  Whan sche him sih, wax al aschamed.[154]
  Tho was here tale newe entamed;[155]
  For sikernesse of Mariage
  Sche fette forth a riche ymage,[156]
  Which was figure of Jupiter,
  And Jason swor and seide ther,
  That also wiss god scholde him helpe,
  That if Medea dede him helpe,
  That he his pourpos myhte wtnne,
  Thei scholde nevere parte atwinne,[157]                         3490
  Bot evere whil him lasteth lif,
  He wolde hire holde for his wif.
  And with that word thei kisten bothe;
  And for thei scholden hem unclothe,
  Ther cam a Maide, and in hir wise
  Sche dede hem bothe full servise,
  Til that thei were in bedde naked:
  I wot that nyht was wel bewaked,
  Thei hadden bothe what thei wolde.
  And thanne of leisir sche him tolde,                            3500
  And gan fro point to point enforme
  Of his bataile and al the forme,
  Which as he scholde finde there,
  Whan he to thyle come were.
    Sche seide, at entre of the pas
  Hou Mars, which god of Armes was,
  Hath set tuo Oxen sterne and stoute,
  That caste fyr and flamme aboute
  Bothe at the mouth and ate nase,
  So that thei setten al on blase                                 3510

  What thing that passeth hem betwene:
  And forthermore upon the grene
  Ther goth the flees of gold to kepe
  A Serpent, which mai nevere slepe.
  Thus who that evere scholde it winne,
  The fyr to stoppe he mot beginne,
  Which that the fierce bestes caste,[158]
  And daunte he mot hem ate laste,
  So that he mai hem yoke and dryve;
  And therupon he mot as blyve                                    3520
  The Serpent with such strengthe assaile,
  That he mai slen him be bataile;
  Of which he mot the teth outdrawe,
  As it belongeth to that lawe,
  And thanne he mot tho Oxen yoke,
  Til thei have with a plowh tobroke
  A furgh of lond, in which arowe
  The teth of thaddre he moste sowe,
  And therof schule arise knihtes
  Wel armed up at alle rihtes.                                    3530
  Of hem is noght to taken hiede,
  For ech of hem in hastihiede
  Schal other slen with dethes wounde:[159]
  And thus whan thei ben leid to grounde,[160]
  Than mot he to the goddes preie,
  And go so forth and take his preie.
  Bot if he faile in eny wise
  Of that ye hiere me devise,
  Ther mai be set non other weie,
  That he ne moste algates deie.                                  3540

  ‘Nou have I told the peril al:

  Quod Medea to Jason tho,
  ‘That ye schul knowen er ye go,

  What schal ben the recoverir.
  Bot, Sire, for it is nyh day,
  Ariseth up, so that I may
  Delivere you what thing I have,
  That mai youre lif and honour save.’                            3550
  Thei weren bothe loth to rise,
  Bot for thei weren bothe wise,
  Up thei arisen ate laste:
  Jason his clothes on him caste
  And made him redi riht anon,
  And sche hir scherte dede upon
  And caste on hire a mantel clos,
  Withoute more and thanne aros.
  Tho tok sche forth a riche Tye
  Mad al of gold and of Perrie,                                   3560
  Out of the which sche nam a Ring,
  The Ston was worth al other thing.
  Sche seide, whil he wolde it were,

  Wher as it comth the fyr is queynt,
  It daunteth ek the cruel beste,
  Ther may no qued that man areste,
  Wher so he be on See or lond,
  Which hath that ring upon his hond:                             3570
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 247=]
  And over that sche gan to sein,
  That if a man wol ben unsein,
  Withinne his hond hold clos the Ston,
  And he mai invisible gon.
  The Ring to Jason sche betauhte,
  And so forth after sche him tauhte
  What sacrifise he scholde make;
  And gan out of hire cofre take
  Him thoughte an hevenely figure,
  Which al be charme and be conjure                               3580
  Was wroght, and ek it was thurgh write
  With names, which be scholde wite,[162]

  Withoute reste of eny while,
  Whan he were londed in that yle,
  He scholde make his sacrifise
  And rede his carecte in the wise
  As sche him tauhte, on knes doun bent,
  Thre sithes toward orient;                                      3590
  For so scholde he the goddes plese
  And winne himselven mochel ese.
  And whanne he hadde it thries rad,
  To opne a buiste sche him bad,

  Enoignte his armes al aboute,
  And for he scholde nothing doute,
  Sche tok him thanne a maner glu,
  The which was of so gret vertu,
  That where a man it wolde caste,

  That noman mihte it don aweie.
  And that sche bad be alle weie

  Of tho tweie Oxen that fyr blowen,                              3610
  Therof to stoppen the malice;
  The glu schal serve of that office.
  And over that hir oignement,

  And whanne he hadde it sesed so,
  That thanne he were sone ago
  Withouten eny tariynge.
    Whan this was seid, into wepinge
  Sche fell, as sche that was thurgh nome
  With love, and so fer overcome,
  That al hir world on him sche sette.
  Bot whan sche sih ther was no lette,
  That he mot nedes parte hire fro,
  Sche tok him in hire armes tuo,                                 3640
  An hundred time and gan him kisse,
  And seide, ‘O, al mi worldes blisse,
  Mi trust, mi lust, mi lif, min hele,

  And with that word sche gan doun falle

  And yit I hope to you bringe
  Withinne a while such tidinge,
  The which schal make ous bothe game.’
    Bot for he wolde kepe hir name,                               3660

  Whan that he wiste it was nyh dai,
  He seide, ‘A dieu, mi swete mai.’
  And forth with him he nam his gere,
  Which as sche hadde take him there,
  And strauht unto his chambre he wente,[166]
  And goth to bedde and slep him hente,
  And lay, that noman him awok,
  For Hercules hiede of him tok,[167]
  Til it was undren hih and more.[168]
  And thanne he gan to sighe sore                                 3670
  And sodeinliche abreide of slep;[169]
  And thei that token of him kep,
  His chamberleins, be sone there,
  And maden redi al his gere,
  And he aros and to the king
  He wente, and seide hou to that thing
  For which he cam he wolde go.
  The king therof was wonder wo,[170]
  And for he wolde him fain withdrawe,
  He tolde him many a dredful sawe,                               3680
  Bot Jason wolde it noght recorde,
  And ate laste thei acorde.
  Whan that he wolde noght abide,
  A Bot was redy ate tyde,
  In which this worthi kniht of Grece
  Ful armed up at every piece,
  To his bataile which belongeth,
  Tok ore on honde and sore him longeth,[171]
  Til he the water passed were.
    Whan he cam to that yle there,                                3690

  He set him on his knes doun strauht,[172]
  And his carecte, as he was tawht,
  He radde, and made his sacrifise,
  And siththe enoignte him in that wise,
  As Medea him hadde bede;
  And thanne aros up fro that stede,
  And with the glu the fyr he queynte,
  And anon after he atteinte
  The grete Serpent and him slowh.
  Bot erst he hadde sorwe ynowh,                                  3700
  For that Serpent made him travaile
  So harde and sore of his bataile,
  That nou he stod and nou he fell:
  For longe time it so befell,
  That with his swerd ne with his spere[173]
  He mihte noght that Serpent dere.[174]
  He was so scherded al aboute,
  It hield all eggetol withoute,
  He was so ruide and hard of skin,
  Ther mihte nothing go therin;                                   3710
  Venym and fyr togedre he caste,
  That he Jason so sore ablaste,
  That if ne were his oignement,
  His Ring and his enchantement,
  Which Medea tok him tofore,
  He hadde with that worm be lore;
  Bot of vertu which therof cam
  Jason the Dragon overcam.
  And he anon the teth outdrouh,
  And sette his Oxen in a plouh,[175]                             3720
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 252=]
  With which he brak a piece of lond
  And sieu hem with his oghne hond.
  Tho mihte he gret merveile se:
  Of every toth in his degre
  Sprong up a kniht with spere and schield,
  Of whiche anon riht in the field
  Echon slow other; and with that
  Jason Medea noght foryat,
  On bothe his knes he gan doun falle,
  And yaf thonk to the goddes alle.                               3730
  The Flees he tok and goth to Bote,
  The Sonne schyneth bryhte and hote,
  The Flees of gold schon forth withal,
  The water glistreth overal.
    Medea wepte and sigheth ofte,
  And stod upon a Tour alofte:
  Al prively withinne hirselve,
  Ther herde it nouther ten ne tuelve,
  Sche preide, and seide, ‘O, god him spede,
  The kniht which hath mi maidenhiede!’                           3740
  And ay sche loketh toward thyle.
  Bot whan sche sih withinne a while[176]
  The Flees glistrende ayein the Sonne,
  Sche saide, ‘Ha lord, now al is wonne,[177]
  Mi kniht the field hath overcome:
  Nou wolde god he were come;
  Ha lord, that he ne were alonde!’[178]
  Bot I dar take this on honde,
  If that sche hadde wynges tuo,
  Sche wolde have flowe unto him tho                              3750

  Strawht ther he was into the Bot.[179]
    The dai was clier, the Sonne hot,
  The Gregeis weren in gret doute,
  The whyle that here lord was oute:
  Thei wisten noght what scholde tyde,
  Bot waiten evere upon the tyde,
  To se what ende scholde falle.
  Ther stoden ek the nobles alle
  Forth with the comun of the toun;
  And as thei loken up and doun,                                  3760
  Thei weren war withinne a throwe,
  Wher cam the bot, which thei wel knowe,
  And sihe hou Jason broghte his preie.
  And tho thei gonnen alle seie,
  And criden alle with o stevene,[180]
  ‘Ha, wher was evere under the hevene
  So noble a knyht as Jason is?’
  And welnyh alle seiden this,
  That Jason was a faie kniht,
  For it was nevere of marines miht                               3770
  The Flees of gold so forto winne;
  And thus to talen thei beginne.[181]
  With that the king com forth anon,
  And sih the Flees, hou that it schon;
  And whan Jason cam to the lond,
  The king himselve tok his hond
  And kist him, and gret joie him made.
  The Gregeis weren wonder glade,
  And of that thing riht merie hem thoghte,
  And forth with hem the Flees thei broghte,                      3780
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 254=]
  And ech on other gan to leyhe;
  Bot wel was him that mihte neyhe,
  To se therof the proprete.
  And thus thei passen the cite
  And gon unto the Paleis straght.
    Medea, which foryat him naght,
  Was redy there, and seide anon,
  ‘Welcome, O worthi kniht Jason.’
  Sche wolde have kist him wonder fayn,
  Bot schame tornede hire agayn;                                  3790
  It was noght the manere as tho,[182]
  Forthi sche dorste noght do so.
  Sche tok hire leve, and Jason wente
  Into his chambre, and sche him sente
  Hire Maide to sen hou he ferde;
  The which whan that sche sih and herde,[183]
  Hou that he hadde faren oute
  And that it stod wel al aboute,[184]
  Sche tolde hire ladi what sche wiste,
  And sche for joie hire Maide kiste.                             3800
  The bathes weren thanne araied,
  With herbes tempred and assaied,
  And Jason was unarmed sone
  And dede as it befell to done:
  Into his bath he wente anon
  And wyssh him clene as eny bon;
  He tok a sopp, and oute he cam,
  And on his beste aray he nam,
  And kempde his hed, whan he was clad,
  And goth him forth al merie and glad                            3810

  Riht strawht into the kinges halle.
  The king cam with his knihtes alle
  And maden him glad welcominge;
  And he hem tolde the tidinge[185]
  Of this and that, hou it befell,
  Whan that he wan the schepes fell.
    Medea, whan sche was asent,
  Com sone to that parlement,
  And whan sche mihte Jason se,
  Was non so glad of alle as sche.                                3820
  Ther was no joie forto seche,
  Of him mad every man a speche,[186]
  Som man seide on, som man seide other;[187]
  Bot thogh he were goddes brother
  And mihte make fyr and thonder,
  Ther mihte be nomore wonder
  Than was of him in that cite.
  Echon tauhte other, ‘This is he,
  Which hath in his pouer withinne
  That al the world ne mihte winne:                               3830
  Lo, hier the beste of alle goode.’
  Thus saiden thei that there stode,
  And ek that walkede up and doun,
  Bothe of the Court and of the toun.
    The time of Souper cam anon,
  Thei wisshen and therto thei gon,
  Medea was with Jason set:
  Tho was ther many a deynte fet
  And set tofore hem on the bord,
  Bot non so likinge as the word                                  3840

  Which was ther spoke among hem tuo,
  So as thei dorste speke tho.
  Bot thogh thei hadden litel space,
  Yit thei acorden in that place
  Hou Jason scholde come at nyht,
  Whan every torche and every liht
  Were oute, and thanne of other thinges[188]
  Thei spieke aloud for supposinges
  Of hem that stoden there aboute:
  For love is everemore in doute,                                 3850
  If that it be wisly governed[189]
  Of hem that ben of love lerned.
    Whan al was don, that dissh and cuppe
  And cloth and bord and al was uppe,
  Thei waken whil hem lest to wake,
  And after that thei leve take
  And gon to bedde forto reste.
  And whan him thoghte for the beste,
  That every man was faste aslepe,
  Jason, that wolde his time kepe,                                3860
  Goth forth stalkende al prively
  Unto the chambre, and redely
  Ther was a Maide, which him kepte.
  Medea wok and nothing slepte,
  Bot natheles sche was abedde,
  And he with alle haste him spedde
  And made him naked and al warm.
  Anon he tok hire in his arm:
  What nede is forto speke of ese?
  Hem list ech other forto plese,                                 3870
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 257=]
  So that thei hadden joie ynow:
  And tho thei setten whanne and how
  That sche with him awey schal stele.
  With wordes suche and othre fele
  Whan al was treted to an ende,
  Jason tok leve and gan forth wende
  Unto his oughne chambre in pes;
  Ther wiste it non bot Hercules.
    He slepte and ros whan it was time,[190]
  And whanne it fell towardes prime,                              3880
  He tok to him suche as he triste
  In secre, that non other wiste,
  And told hem of his conseil there,[191]
  And seide that his wille were
  That thei to Schipe hadde alle thinge
  So priveliche in thevenynge,
  That noman mihte here dede aspie
  Bot tho that were of compaignie:[192]
  For he woll go withoute leve,
  And lengere woll he noght beleve;                               3890
  Bot he ne wolde at thilke throwe
  The king or queene scholde it knowe.
  Thei saide, ‘Al this schal wel be do:’
  And Jason truste wel therto.
    Medea in the mene while,
  Which thoghte hir fader to beguile,
  The Tresor which hir fader hadde
  With hire al priveli sche ladde,
  And with Jason at time set
  Awey sche stal and fond no let,                                 3900

  And straght sche goth hire unto schipe
  Of Grece with that felaschipe,
  And thei anon drowe up the Seil.
  And al that nyht this was conseil,
  Bot erly, whan the Sonne schon,
  Men syhe hou that thei were agon,
  And come unto the king and tolde:
  And he the sothe knowe wolde,
  And axeth where his dowhter was.
  Ther was no word bot Out, Allas!                                3910

  The fader as a wod man lepte,
  And gan the time forto warie,
  And swor his oth he wol noght tarie,[193]
  That with Caliphe and with galeie
  The same cours, the same weie,
  Which Jason tok, he wolde take,
  If that he mihte him overtake.
  To this thei seiden alle yee:
  Anon thei weren ate See,                                        3920
  And alle, as who seith, at a word

  The Sail goth up, and forth thei strauhte.
  Bot non espleit therof thei cauhte,
  And so thei tornen hom ayein,
  For al that labour was in vein.
    Jason to Grece with his preie
  Goth thurgh the See the rihte weie:

  And olde Eson gret joie made                                    3940
  To sen thencress of his lignage;
  For he was of so gret an Age,
  That men awaiten every day,
  Whan that he scholde gon away.
  Jason, which sih his fader old,
  Upon Medea made him bold,
  Of art magique, which sche couthe,

  Sche preide, and ek hield up hir hond                           3980
  To Echates, and gan to crie,

  Sche seide, ‘Helpeth at this nede,
  And as ye maden me to spede,
  Whan Jason cam the Flees to seche,
  So help me nou, I you beseche.’
  With that sche loketh and was war,
  Doun fro the Sky ther cam a char,
  The which Dragouns aboute drowe:
  And tho sche gan hir hed doun bowe,[200]                        3990

  Of jus, of water and of blod,                                   4120

  The which men hiere on nyhtes houle;
  And of a Raven, which was told
  Of nyne hundred wynter old,

  Of the Seewolf, and for the hele[218]
  Of Eson, with a thousand mo
  Of thinges that sche hadde tho,[219]                            4140

  A drie branche hem with to stere,
  The which anon gan floure and bere
  And waxe al freissh and grene ayein.
  Whan sche this vertu hadde sein,
  Sche let the leste drope of alle
  Upon the bare flor doun falle;

  For wher thei se beyete sterte,[247]
  That schal hem in no wise asterte,

  Of lucre, which Usure hath set.

  To al that evere he beith and selleth[248]
  He hath ordeined of his sleyhte

  And with the more he makth his tasse,                           4400
  Wherof his hous is full withinne.

  Lovers, that thogh thei love a lyte,[250]

  Bot certes such usure unliche
  It falleth more unto the riche,

    Nou, Sone, of that I seide above
  Thou wost what Usure is of love:
  Tell me forthi what so thou wilt,

    Mi fader, nay, for ought I hiere.

  I wol you be mi trouthe assure,
  Mi weyhte of love and mi mesure
  Hath be mor large and mor certein
  Than evere I tok of love ayein:                                 4440
  For so yit couthe I nevere of sleyhte,
  To take ayein be double weyhte
  Of love mor than I have yive.
  For als so wiss mot I be schrive
  And have remission of Sinne,
  As so yit couthe I nevere winne,
  Ne yit so mochel, soth to sein,
  That evere I mihte have half ayein
  Of so full love as I have lent:
  And if myn happ were so wel went,                               4450
  That for the hole I mihte have half,
  Me thenkth I were a goddeshalf.[255]
  For where Usure wole have double,
  Mi conscience is noght so trouble,
  I biede nevere as to my del
  Bot of the hole an halvendel;
  That is non excess, as me thenketh.
  Bot natheles it me forthenketh;
  For wel I wot that wol noght be,
  For every day the betre I se                                    4460
  That hou so evere I yive or lene
  Mi love in place ther I mene,[256]
  For oght that evere I axe or crave,
  I can nothing ayeinward have.
  Bot yit for that I wol noght lete,
  What so befalle of mi beyete,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 277=]

  Rewarde wol me noght again,
  I wot the laste of my bargain
  Schal stonde upon so gret a lost,
  That I mai neveremor the cost

  So that touchende of this partie
  I mai me wel excuse and schal;
  And forto speke forth withal,
  If eny brocour for me wente,
  That point cam nevere in myn entente:                           4480
  So that the more me merveilleth,

  That al myn herte and al my time

  Which as ye telle in love is used,
  Mi ladi mai noght ben excused;
  That for o lokinge of hire yë

  And yive a part, ther sche hath al.
  I not what falle hierafter schal,                               4500

  I not hou sche hire conscience

  Be large weyhte and gret mesure
  Sche hath mi love, and I have noght
  Of that which I have diere boght,                               4510
  And with myn herte I have it paid;
  Bot al that is asyde laid,[261]
  And I go loveles aboute.
  Hire oghte stonde in ful gret doute,
  Til sche redresce such a sinne,
  That sche wole al mi love winne
  And yifth me noght to live by:
  Noght als so moche as ‘grant mercy’[262]

  Som of mi grete peine allyhte.                                  4520
  Bot of this point, lo, thus I fare
  As he that paith for his chaffare,
  And beith it diere, and yit hath non,[263]

  Thus beie I diere and have no love,[264]

  To winne of love non encress.
  Bot I me wole natheles
  Touchende usure of love aquite;
  And if mi ladi be to wyte,                                      4530
  I preie to god such grace hir sende

    Mi Sone, of that thou hast ansuerd
  Touchende Usure I have al herd,

  For be thin oghne knowlechinge

  So hast thou wel thin herte sold,
  Whan thou hast that is more worth.
  And ek of that thou tellest forth,
  Hou that hire weyhte of love unevene

  Stod nevere in evene that balance
  Which stant in loves governance.                                4550
  Such is the statut of his lawe,
  That thogh thi love more drawe
  And peise in the balance more,
  Thou miht noght axe ayein therfore
  Of duete, bot al of grace.

  For Juno with hire wordes hote,

    Mi Sone, that is riht wel do.
  For often times of scarsnesse
  It hath be sen, that for the lesse
  Is lost the more, as thou schalt hiere
  A tale lich to this matiere.                                    4780

                              [Sidenote: [TALE OF BABIO AND CROCEUS.]]
    Skarsnesse and love acorden nevere,
  For every thing is wel the levere,
  Whan that a man hath boght it diere:
      [Sidenote: Hic loquitur contra istos, qui Auaricia stricti
      largitatis beneficium in amoris causa confundunt. Et ponit
      exemplum, qualiter Croceus largus et hillaris Babionem[292]
      auarum et tenacem de amore Viole, que pulcherrima fuit,
      donis largissimis circumuenit.]
  And forto speke in this matiere,
  For sparinge of a litel cost
  Fulofte time a man hath lost
  The large cote for the hod.
  What man that scars is of his good[291]
  And wol noght yive, he schal noght take:
  With yifte a man mai undertake                                  4790

                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 288=]
  For every creature bore,
  If thou him yive, is glad therfore,
  And every gladschipe, as I finde,
  Is confort unto loves kinde
  And causeth ofte a man to spede.
  So was he wys that ferst yaf mede,
  For mede kepeth love in house;
  Bot wher the men ben coveitouse                                 4800
  And sparen forto yive a part,
  Thei knowe noght Cupides art:
  For his fortune and his aprise
  Desdeigneth alle coveitise
  And hateth alle nygardie.
  And forto loke of this partie,
  A soth ensample, hou it is so,
    I finde write of Babio;[294]
  Which hadde a love at his menage,
  Ther was non fairere of hire age,                               4810
  And hihte Viola be name;
  Which full of youthe and ful of game
  Was of hirself, and large and fre,
  Bot such an other chinche as he[295]
  Men wisten noght in al the lond,
  And hadde affaited to his hond
  His servant, the which Spodius[296]
  Was hote. And in this wise thus[297]
  The worldes good of sufficance
  Was had, bot likinge and plesance,                              4820
  Of that belongeth to richesse
  Of love, stod in gret destresse;
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 289=]
  So that this yonge lusty wyht
  Of thing which fell to loves riht
  Was evele served overal,
  That sche was wo bego withal,
  Til that Cupide and Venus eke
  A medicine for the seke
  Ordeigne wolden in this cas.
  So as fortune thanne was,                                       4830
  Of love upon the destine
  It fell, riht as it scholde be,
  A freissh, a fre, a frendly man
  That noght of Avarice can,
  Which Croceus be name hihte,
  Toward this swete caste his sihte,
  And ther sche was cam in presence.
  Sche sih him large of his despence,
  And amorous and glad of chiere,
  So that hir liketh wel to hiere                                 4840
  The goodly wordes whiche he seide;
  And therupon of love he preide,
  Of love was al that he mente,
  To love and for sche scholde assente,
  He yaf hire yiftes evere among.
  Bot for men sein that mede is strong,
  It was wel seene at thilke tyde;
  For as it scholde of ryht betyde,
  This Viola largesce hath take
  And the nygard sche hath forsake:                               4850
  Of Babio sche wol no more,[298]
  For he was grucchende everemore,

  Bot forto prinche and forto spare,
  Of worldes muk to gete encress.
  So goth the wrecche loveles,[299]
  Bejaped for his Skarcete,
  And he that large was and fre
  And sette his herte to despende,
  This Croceus, the bowe bende,                                   4860
  Which Venus tok him forto holde,
  And schotte als ofte as evere he wolde.[300]
    Lo, thus departeth love his lawe,
  That what man wol noght be felawe
  To yive and spende, as I thee telle,
  He is noght worthi forto duelle
  In loves court to be relieved.
  Forthi, my Sone, if I be lieved,[301]
  Thou schalt be large of thi despence.

  Unto his wif and thus he seide,
  ‘Lo, hier my gold, lo, hier mi Ston!’
  His wif hath wonder therupon,
  And axeth him hou that mai be.

  His Ston to selle, and he so dede,[330]
  And lefte it with his chapman there.

  And swor therto al that he couthe
  To parte and yiven half his good,

  As he which wol no trouthe holde.
    This Emperour al that he tolde                                5140
  Hath herd, and thilke unkindenesse
  He seide he wolde himself redresse.
  And thus in court of juggement
  This Adrian was thanne assent,
  And the querele in audience[336]
  Declared was in the presence
  Of themperour and many mo;
  Wherof was mochel speche tho
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 300=]

  For the partie which hath pleigned
  The lawe hath diemed and ordeigned
  Be hem that were avised wel,
  That he schal have the halvendel
  Thurghout of Adrianes good.
  And thus of thilke unkinde blod
  Stant the memoire into this day,[337]
  Wherof that every wysman may[338]
  Ensamplen him, and take in mynde[339]

    Forthi, mi Sone, in thin office
  I rede fle that ilke vice.
  For riht as the Cronique seith
  Of Adrian, hou he his feith
  Foryat for worldes covoitise,
  Fulofte in such a maner wise
  Of lovers nou a man mai se
  Full manye that unkinde be:                                     5170
  For wel behote and evele laste
  That is here lif; for ate laste,
  Whan that thei have here wille do,
  Here love is after sone ago.
  What seist thou, Sone, to this cas?

    Mi fader, I wol seie Helas,
  That evere such a man was bore,
  Which whan he hath his trouthe suore
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 301=]
  And hath of love what he wolde,
  That he at eny time scholde[340]                                5180
  Evere after in his herte finde
  To falsen and to ben unkinde.
  Bot, fader, as touchende of me,
  I mai noght stonde in that degre;
  For I tok nevere of love why,
  That I ne mai wel go therby
  And do my profit elles where,
  For eny sped I finde there.
  I dar wel thenken al aboute,
  Bot I ne dar noght speke it oute;                               5190
  And if I dorste, I wolde pleigne,
  That sche for whom I soffre peine
  And love hir evere aliche hote,
  That nouther yive ne behote
  In rewardinge of mi servise
  It list hire in no maner wise.
  I wol noght say that sche is kinde,
  And forto sai sche is unkinde,
  That dar I noght; bot god above,[341]
  Which demeth every herte of love,                               5200
  He wot that on myn oghne side
  Schal non unkindeschipe abide:
  If it schal with mi ladi duelle,
  Therof dar I nomore telle.[342]
  Nou, goode fader, as it is,
  Tell me what thenketh you of this.
                                                [Sidenote: Confessor.]
    Mi Sone, of that unkindeschipe,
  The which toward thi ladischipe

  Thou pleignest, for sche wol thee noght,
  Thou art to blamen of that thoght.[343]                         5210
  For it mai be that thi desir,
  Thogh it brenne evere as doth the fyr,
  Per cas to hire honour missit,
  Or elles time com noght yit,
  Which standt upon thi destine:[344]
  Forthi, mi Sone, I rede thee,
  Thenk wel, what evere the befalle;
  For noman hath his lustes alle.
  Bot as thou toldest me before
  That thou to love art noght forswore,                           5220
  And hast don non unkindenesse,
  Thou miht therof thi grace blesse:
  And lef noght that continuance;
  For ther mai be no such grevance
  To love, as is unkindeschipe.[345]
  Wherof to kepe thi worschipe,
  So as these olde bokes tale,
  I schal thee telle a redi tale:

    Mynos, as telleth the Poete,
  The which whilom was king of Crete,
  A Sone hadde and Androchee
      [Sidenote: Hic ponit exemplum contra viros amori ingratos.
      Et narrat qualiter Theseus Cadmi filius, consilio suffultus[347]

      dicitur Minotaurum vicit:[348] vnde Theseus Adriagne sponsalia

  He hihte: and so befell that he
  Unto Athenes forto lere
  Was send, and so he bar him there,[346]
  For that he was of hih lignage,
  Such pride he tok in his corage,

  He dede manye thinges wronge;
  And useth thilke lif so longe,[349]
  Til ate laste of that he wroghte
  He fond the meschief which he soghte,
  Wherof it fell that he was slain.
  His fader, which it herde sain,
  Was wroth, and al that evere he mihte,
  Of men of Armes he him dighte[350]
  A strong pouer, and forth he wente
  Unto Athenys, where he brente
  The pleine contre al aboute:                                    5250
  The Cites stode of him in doute,
  As thei that no defence hadde[351]
  Ayein the pouer which he ladde.

  His conseil tok upon this thing,
  For he was thanne in the Cite:

  That king Mynos fro yer to yeere
  Receive schal, as thou schalt here,
  Out of Athenys for truage
  Of men that were of myhti Age
  Persones nyne, of whiche he schal
  His wille don in special
  For vengance of his Sones deth.
  Non other grace ther ne geth,

  And that was don in such a wise,                                5270
  Which stod upon a wonder cas.
  For thilke time so it was,
  Wherof that men yit rede and singe,
  King Mynos hadde in his kepinge
  A cruel Monstre, as seith the geste:
  For he was half man and half beste,
  And Minotaurus he was hote,[352]
  Which was begete in a riote
  Upon Pasiphe, his oghne wif,
  Whil he was oute upon the strif                                 5280
  Of thilke grete Siege at Troie.[353]
  Bot sche, which lost hath alle joie,[354]
  Whan that sche syh this Monstre bore,
  Bad men ordeigne anon therfore:
  And fell that ilke time thus,
  Ther was a Clerk, on Dedalus,
  Which hadde ben of hire assent
  Of that hir world was so miswent;[355]
  And he made of his oghne wit,
  Wherof the remembrance is yit,                                  5290
  For Minotaure such an hous,
  Which was so strange and merveilous,
  That what man that withinne wente,
  Ther was so many a sondri wente,
  That he ne scholde noght come oute,
  But gon amased al aboute.
  And in this hous to loke and warde
  Was Minotaurus put in warde,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 305=]
  That what lif that therinne cam,[356]
  Or man or beste, he overcam                                     5300
  And slow, and fedde him therupon;
  And in this wise many on[357]
  Out of Athenys for truage
  Devoured weren in that rage.
  For every yeer thei schope hem so,
  Thei of Athenys, er thei go
  Toward that ilke wofull chance,
  As it was set in ordinance,[358]
  Upon fortune here lot thei caste;
  Til that Theseüs ate laste,                                     5310
  Which was the kinges Sone there,
  Amonges othre that ther were
  In thilke yeer, as it befell,
  The lot upon his chance fell.
  He was a worthi kniht withalle;
  And whan he sih this chance falle,[359]
  He ferde as thogh he tok non hiede,
  Bot al that evere he mihte spiede,
  With him and with his felaschipe
  Forth into Crete he goth be Schipe;                             5320
  Wher that the king Mynos he soghte,[360]
  And profreth all that he him oghte
  Upon the point of here acord.
    This sterne king, this cruel lord
  Tok every day on of the Nyne,
  And put him to the discipline[361]
  Of Minotaure, to be devoured;
  Bot Theseüs was so favoured,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 306=]
  That he was kept til ate laste.
  And in the meene while he caste                                 5330
  What thing him were best to do:
  And fell that Adriagne tho,
  Which was the dowhter of Mynos,
  And hadde herd the worthi los
  Of Theseüs and of his myht,
  And syh he was a lusti kniht,
  Hire hole herte on him sche leide,
  And he also of love hir preide,
  So ferforth that thei were al on.
  And sche ordeigneth thanne anon                                 5340
  In what manere he scholde him save,[362]
  And schop so that sche dede him have
  A clue of thred, of which withinne
  Ferst ate dore he schal beginne
  With him to take that on ende,
  That whan he wolde ayeinward wende,[363]
  He mihte go the same weie.
  And over this, so as I seie,
  Of pich sche tok him a pelote,[364]
  The which he scholde into the throte                            5350
  Of Minotaure caste rihte:
  Such wepne also for him sche dighte,
  That he be reson mai noght faile
  To make an ende of his bataile;
  For sche him tawhte in sondri wise,
  Til he was knowe of thilke emprise,
  Hou he this beste schulde quelle.[365]
  And thus, schort tale forto telle,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 307=]
  So as this Maide him hadde tawht,[366]
  Theseüs with this Monstre fawht,                                5360
  Smot of his hed, the which he nam,
  And be the thred, so as he cam,
  He goth ayein, til he were oute.
  Tho was gret wonder al aboute:[367]
  Mynos the tribut hath relessed,
  And so was al the werre cessed
  Betwen Athene and hem of Crete.
    Bot now to speke of thilke suete,
  Whos beaute was withoute wane,
  This faire Maiden Adriane,                                      5370
  Whan that sche sih Theseüs sound,
  Was nevere yit upon the ground[368]
  A gladder wyht than sche was tho.
  Theseüs duelte a dai or tuo
  Wher that Mynos gret chiere him dede:
  Theseüs in a prive stede
  Hath with this Maiden spoke and rouned,
  That sche to him was abandouned
  In al that evere that sche couthe,
  So that of thilke lusty youthe                                  5380
  Al prively betwen hem tweie
  The ferste flour he tok aweie.
  For he so faire tho behihte
  That evere, whil he live mihte,
  He scholde hire take for his wif,
  And as his oghne hertes lif
  He scholde hire love and trouthe bere;[369]
  And sche, which mihte noght forbere,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 308=]
  So sore loveth him ayein,
  That what as evere he wolde sein                                5390
  With al hire herte sche believeth.
  And thus his pourpos he achieveth,
  So that assured of his trouthe
  With him sche wente, and that was routhe.
    Fedra hire yonger Soster eke,
  A lusti Maide, a sobre, a meke,
  Fulfild of alle curtesie,
  For Sosterhode and compainie
  Of love, which was hem betuene,
  To sen hire Soster mad a queene,                                5400
  Hire fader lefte and forth sche wente
  With him, which al his ferste entente
  Foryat withinne a litel throwe,
  So that it was al overthrowe,
  Whan sche best wende it scholde stonde.
  The Schip was blowe fro the londe,
  Wherin that thei seilende were;
  This Adriagne hath mochel fere
  Of that the wynd so loude bleu,
  As sche which of the See ne kneu,                               5410
  And preide forto reste a whyle.[370]
  And so fell that upon an yle,
  Which Chyo hihte, thei ben drive,
  Where he to hire his leve hath yive
  That sche schal londe and take hire reste.
  Bot that was nothing for the beste:
  For whan sche was to londe broght,
  Sche, which that time thoghte noght
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 309=]
  Bot alle trouthe, and tok no kepe,
  Hath leid hire softe forto slepe,                               5420
  As sche which longe hath ben forwacched;
  Bot certes sche was evele macched
  And fer from alle loves kinde;
  For more than the beste unkinde
  Theseüs, which no trouthe kepte,
  Whil that this yonge ladi slepte,
  Fulfild of his unkindeschipe[371]
  Hath al foryete the goodschipe
  Which Adriane him hadde do,
  And bad unto the Schipmen tho[372]                              5430
  Hale up the seil and noght abyde,
  And forth he goth the same tyde
  Toward Athene, and hire alonde
  He lefte, which lay nyh the stronde
  Slepende, til that sche awok.
  Bot whan that sche cast up hire lok
  Toward the stronde and sih no wyht,
  Hire herte was so sore aflyht,[373]
  That sche ne wiste what to thinke;
  Bot drouh hire to the water brinke,                             5440
  Wher sche behield the See at large.
  Sche sih no Schip, sche sih no barge
  Als ferforth as sche mihte kenne:
  ‘Ha lord,’ sche seide, ‘which a Senne,
  As al the world schal after hiere,
  Upon this woful womman hiere

  And so deserved ate nede,[374]
  Whan that he stod upon his drede,                               5450
  And ek the love he me behihte.
  It is gret wonder hou he mihte
  Towardes me nou ben unkinde,
  And so to lete out of his mynde
  Thing which he seide his oghne mouth.
  Bot after this whan it is couth[375]
  And drawe into the worldes fame,[376]
  It schal ben hindringe of his name:
  For wel he wot and so wot I,
  He yaf his trouthe bodily,                                      5460
  That he myn honour scholde kepe.’
  And with that word sche gan to wepe,
  And sorweth more than ynouh:
  Hire faire tresces sche todrouh,[377]
  And with hirself tok such a strif,[378]
  That sche betwen the deth and lif[379]

  Wherof the wrong schal everemo                                  5470
  Stonde in Cronique of remembrance.
  And ek it asketh a vengance
  To ben unkinde in loves cas,
  So as Theseüs thanne was,
  Al thogh he were a noble kniht;
  For he the lawe of loves riht
  Forfeted hath in alle weie,
  That Adriagne he putte aweie,

  And after this, so as I rede,[381]                              5480
  Fedra, the which hir Soster is,
  He tok in stede of hire, and this
  Fel afterward to mochel teene.
  For thilke vice of which I meene,
  Unkindeschipe, where it falleth,
  The trouthe of mannes herte it palleth,
  That he can no good dede aquite:
  So mai he stonde of no merite
  Towardes god, and ek also

  And forto duelle in prive place,
  That noman scholde sen hir face
  For schame, which mai noght be lassed,
  Of thing that was tofore passed,
  Whan that sche loste hir maidenhiede:
  For evere upon hir wommanhiede,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 327=]
  Thogh that the goddes wolde hire change,
  Sche thenkth, and is the more strange,[439]
  And halt hir clos the wyntres day.
  Bot whan the wynter goth away,                                  5960
  And that Nature the goddesse
  Wole of hir oughne fre largesse[440]
  With herbes and with floures bothe
  The feldes and the medwes clothe,
  And ek the wodes and the greves
  Ben heled al with grene leves,[441]
  So that a brid hire hyde mai,
  Betwen Averil and March and Maii,
  Sche that the wynter hield hir clos,
  For pure schame and noght aros,                                 5970
  Whan that sche seth the bowes thikke,[442]
  And that ther is no bare sticke,
  Bot al is hid with leves grene,
  To wode comth this Philomene[443]
  And makth hir ferste yeres flyht;
  Wher as sche singeth day and nyht,
  And in hir song al openly[444]
  Sche makth hir pleignte and seith, ‘O why,
  O why ne were I yit a maide?’[445]
  For so these olde wise saide,                                   5980
  Which understoden what sche mente,[446]

  And seith, ‘Ha, nou I am a brid,

  Thogh I have lost mi Maidenhede,

  Thus medleth sche with joie wo
  And with hir sorwe merthe also,                                 5990
  So that of loves maladie
  Sche makth diverse melodie,
  And seith love is a wofull blisse,
  A wisdom which can noman wisse,
  A lusti fievere, a wounde softe:
  This note sche reherceth ofte
  To hem whiche understonde hir tale.
  Nou have I of this nyhtingale,
  Which erst was cleped Philomene,
  Told al that evere I wolde mene,                                6000
  Bothe of hir forme and of hir note,
  Wherof men mai the storie note.
    And of hir Soster Progne I finde,
  Hou sche was torned out of kinde
  Into a Swalwe swift of winge,
  Which ek in wynter lith swounynge,
  Ther as sche mai nothing be sene:
  Bot whan the world is woxe grene[447]
  And comen is the Somertide,
  Than fleth sche forth and ginth to chide,                       6010
  And chitreth out in hir langage[448]
  What falshod is in mariage,[449]
  And telleth in a maner speche
  Of Tereüs the Spousebreche.
  Sche wol noght in the wodes duelle,
  For sche wolde openliche telle;[450]
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 329=]

  Among the folk sche comth to house,
  To do thes wyves understonde[451]
  The falshod of hire housebonde,[452]                            6020
  That thei of hem be war also,
  For ther ben manye untrewe of tho.
  Thus ben the Sostres briddes bothe,
  And ben toward the men so lothe,
  That thei ne wole of pure schame
  Unto no mannes hand be tame;[453]
  For evere it duelleth in here mynde
  Of that thei founde a man unkinde,
  And that was false Tereüs.

  And natheles in remembrance
  I wol declare what vengance
  The goddes hadden him ordeined,
  Of that the Sostres hadden pleigned:
  For anon after he was changed
  And from his oghne kinde stranged,                              6040
  A lappewincke mad he was,
  And thus he hoppeth on the gras,[454]
  And on his hed ther stant upriht
  A creste in tokne he was a kniht;[455]
  And yit unto this dai men seith,
  A lappewincke hath lore his feith[456]
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 330=]
  And is the brid falseste of alle.
                                                [Sidenote: Confessor.]
    Bewar, mi Sone, er thee so falle;[457]
  For if thou be of such covine,
  To gete of love be Ravine                                       6050
  Thi lust, it mai thee falle thus,
  As it befell of Tereüs.[458]

  For I hire love, and who so dredeth,

      Pallas ipsam e manibus eius virginitate seruata gracius
      liberauit.]
  Which was in hire time tho;
  And sche was of the chambre also
  Of Pallas, which is the goddesse
  And wif to Marte, of whom prouesse                              6150
  Is yove to these worthi knihtes.[469]
  For he is of so grete mihtes,
  That he governeth the bataille;

  Bot he feihte under his banere.

  Al one as sche wente on a dai                                   6160
  Upon the stronde forto pleie,
  Ther cam Neptunus in the weie,[470]

  Which hath the See in governance;
  And in his herte such plesance
  He tok, whan he this Maide sih,
  That al his herte aros on hih,
  For he so sodeinliche unwar[471]
  Behield the beaute that sche bar.
  And caste anon withinne his herte
  That sche him schal no weie asterte,                            6170
  Bot if he take in avantage
  Fro thilke maide som pilage,
  Noght of the broches ne the Ringes,
  Bot of some othre smale thinges
  He thoghte parte, er that sche wente;
  And hire in bothe hise armes hente,
  And putte his hond toward the cofre,
  Wher forto robbe he made a profre,[472]
  That lusti tresor forto stele,
  Which passeth othre goodes fele                                 6180
  And cleped is the maidenhede,
  Which is the flour of wommanhede.
  This Maiden, which Cornix be name
  Was hote, dredende alle schame,
  Sih that sche mihte noght debate,
  And wel sche wiste he wolde algate
  Fulfille his lust of Robberie,
  Anon began to wepe and crie,
  And seide, ‘O Pallas, noble queene,
  Scheu nou thi myht and let be sene,[473]                        6190
  To kepe and save myn honour:

  Which nou under thi keie is loke.’
  That word was noght so sone spoke,
  Whan Pallas schop recoverir
  After the will and the desir
  Of hire, which a Maiden was,
  And sodeinliche upon this cas
  Out of hire wommanisshe kinde
  Into a briddes like I finde                                     6200
  Sche was transformed forth withal,
  So that Neptunus nothing stal
  Of such thing as he wolde have stole.
  With fetheres blake as eny cole
  Out of hise armes in a throwe
  Sche flih before his yhe a Crowe;
  Which was to hire a more delit,
  To kepe hire maidenhede whit
  Under the wede of fethers blake,
  In Perles whyte than forsake                                    6210
  That no lif mai restore ayein.
  Bot thus Neptune his herte in vein
  Hath upon Robberie sett;
  The bridd is flowe and he was let,
  The faire Maide him hath ascaped,[474]
  Wherof for evere he was bejaped
  And scorned of that he hath lore.

  The holy thing from holy place.
    The secounde is, if he pourchace                             7020*
  By wey of thefte unholy thing,
  Which he upon his knowleching
  Fro holy place aweie took.
    The thridde point, as seith the book,
  Is such as, wher as evere it be,[590]
  In woode, in feld or in Cite,
  Schal no man stele by no wise
  That halwed is to the servise
  Of god which alle thinges wot.
  But ther is nouther cold ne hot,                               7030*
  Which he for god or man wol spare,
  So that the body may wel fare;
  And that he may the world aschape,
  The hevene him thenkth is but a jape:[591]
  And thus, the sothe for to telle,
  He rifleth bothe book and belle,[592]

  That he ne brekth the holinesse                                 6990
  And doth to god no reverence;
  For he hath lost his conscience,
  That though the Prest therfore curse,
  He seith he fareth noght the wurse.[593]
    And forto speke it otherwise,
  What man that lasseth the franchise                          (7050*)

  Which unto Crist himself is due,[594]
  Benymth, he mai noght wel eschue
  The peine comende afterward;
  For he hath mad his foreward

  Which hath his heritage in helle.

    Er Rome cam to the creance
  Of Cristes feith, it fell per chance,
      [Sidenote: Hic loquitur de illis qui laruata consciencia
      Sacrilegium sibi licere fingunt. Et narrat quod, cum quidam
      Lucius clericus famosus et Imperatori notus deum suum Apollinem
      in templo Rome de anulo suo, pallio et barba aurea spoliasset,
      ipse tandem apprehensus et coram Imperatore accusatus taliter se
      excusando ait: ‘Anulum a deo recepi, quia ipse digito protenso
      ex sua largitate anulum hunc graciose michi optulit; pallium ex
      lamine aureo constructum tuli, quia aurum maxime ponderosum et
      frigidum naturaliter consistit, vnde nec in estate propter pondus
      nec in yeme propter frigus ad dei vestes vtile fuit; barbam ab
      eo[605] deposui, quia ipsum patri suo assimilare volui,[606]
      nam et Apollo, qui ante ipsum in templo[607] stetit, absque
      barba iuvenis apparuit. Et sic ea que gessi non ex furto set
      honestate[608] processisse manifeste declaraui.’]
    Cesar, which tho was Emperour,
  Him liste forto don honour
  Unto the temple Apollinis,
  And made an ymage upon this,                                   7110*
  The which was cleped Apollo.
  Was non so riche in Rome tho;
  Of plate of gold a berd he hadde,
  The which his brest al overspradde;
  Of gold also withoute faile
  His mantell was of large entaile,
  Beset with perrie al aboute,
  Forthriht he strawhte his finger oute,
  Upon the which he hadde a ryng,
  To sen it was a riche thing,                                   7120*
  A fin Carbuncle for the nones,[604]
  Most precious of alle Stones.
    And fell that time in Rome thus:
  Ther was a clerk, on Lucius,
  A Courteour, a famous man,
  Of every witt somwhat he can,
  Outake that him lacketh reule
  His oghne astat to guide and reule;
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 367=]
  How so it stod of his spekinge,
  He was noght wys in his doinge.                                7130*
  Bot every riot ate laste
  Mot nedes falle and mai noght laste:
  After the meede of his decerte,
  So fell this clerk into poverte
  And wiste noght how forto ryse;
  Wherof in many a sondri wyse
  He caste his wittes hier and ther,
  He loketh nyh, he loketh fer,
  Til on a time that he com
  Into the temple, and hiede he nom[609]                         7140*
  Wher that the god Apollo stod.
  He sih the richesse and the good,
  And thoghte he wolde be som weie
  The tresor pyke and stele aweie;
  And therupon so slyhly wroghte,
  That his pourpos aboute he broghte,
  And wente awey unaparceived.
  Thus hath the man his god deceived,[610]
  His ryng, his mantell and his beerd,
  As he which nothing was a feerd,[611]                          7150*
  Al prively with him he bar:
  And whan the wardeins weren war
  Of that here god despuiled was,
  Hem thoghte it was a wonder cas,
  How that a man for eny wele
  Durste in so holy place stele,[612]
  And namely so gret a thing.[613]
  This tale cam unto the king,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 368=]
  And was thurgh spoken overal:
  Bot forto knowe in special                                     7160*
  What maner man hath do the dede,
  Thei soghten help upon the nede
  And maden calculacioun,
  Wherof be demonstracioun
  The man was founde with the good.
  In juggement and whan he stood,
  The king hath axed of him thus:
  ‘Sey, thou unsely Lucius,
  Whi hast thou do this sacrilegge?’
    ‘Mi lord, if I the cause allegge,’                           7170*
  Quod he ayein, ‘me thenketh this,
  That I have do nothing amis.
  Thre pointz ther ben whiche I have do,
  Wherof the ferste point stant so,
  That I the ryng have take aweie.
  As unto that this wole I seie:[614]
  Whan I the god behield aboute,
  I sih how he his hond strawhte oute
  And profred me the ryng to yive;
  And I, which wolde gladly live                                 7180*
  Out of poverte of his largesse,[615]
  It underfing, so that I gesse,
  As therof I am noght to wyte.[616]
  And overmore I wol me quite,
  Of gold that I the mantell tok:
  Gold in his kinde, as seith the bok,
  Is hevy bothe and cold also;
  And for that it was hevy so,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 369=]
  Me thoghte it was no garnement
  Unto the god convenient,                                       7190*
  To clothen him the somer tide;
  I thoghte upon that other side
  How gold is cold, and such a cloth
  Be resoun oghte to be loth
  In wynter time for the chele.
  And thus thenkende thoghtes fele,
  As I myn yhe aboute caste,
  His large beerd thanne ate laste
  I syh, and thoghte anon therfore
  How that his fader him before,                                 7200*
  Which stod upon the same place,
  Was beerdles with a yongly face:
  And in such wise as ye have herd
  I tok awey the Sones berd,[617]
  For that his fader hadde non,
  To make hem liche, and hier upon
  I axe forto ben excused.’
    Lo thus, wher Sacrilegge is used,
  A man can feigne his conscience;
  And riht upon such evidence                                    7210*

  And so ther thenken tuo or thre,
  And yit he loveth non of alle,

  The cause why that he so doth
  Is forto stele an herte or tuo,

  The cause why this tale I telle,[641]
  Upon the chances that befelle.
    King Lamedon, which deide thus,
  He hadde a Sone, on Priamus,
  Which was noght thilke time at hom:
  Bot whan he herde of this, he com,
  And fond hou the Cite was falle,
  Which he began anon to walle                                    7230
  And made ther a cite newe,
  That thei whiche othre londes knewe
  Tho seiden, that of lym and Ston
  In al the world so fair was non.
  And on that o side of the toun
  The king let maken Ylioun,[642]
  That hihe Tour, that stronge place,
  Which was adrad of no manace
  Of quarel nor of non engin;
  And thogh men wolde make a Myn,                                 7240
  No mannes craft it mihte aproche,
  For it was sett upon a roche.
  The walles of the toun aboute,
  Hem stod of al the world no doute,
  And after the proporcion
  Sex gates weren of the toun
  Of such a forme, of such entaile,
  That hem to se was gret mervaile:
  The diches weren brode and depe,
  A fewe men it mihte kepe                                        7250
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 377=]
  From al the world, as semeth tho,
  Bot if the goddes weren fo.
  Gret presse unto that cite drouh,
  So that ther was of poeple ynouh,
  Of Burgeis that therinne duellen;
  Ther mai no mannes tunge tellen
  Hou that cite was riche of good.[643]
    Whan al was mad and al wel stod,
  King Priamus tho him bethoghte
  What thei of Grece whilom wroghte,                              7260
  And what was of her swerd devoured,
  And hou his Soster deshonoured
  With Thelamon awey was lad:
  And so thenkende he wax unglad,[644]
  And sette anon a parlement,
  To which the lordes were assent.
  In many a wise ther was spoke,
  Hou that thei mihten ben awroke,
  Bot ate laste natheles
  Thei seiden alle, ‘Acord and pes.’                              7270

  It thoghte hem thanne for the beste                          (7450*)
  With resonable amendement;
  And thus was Anthenor forth sent[646]
  To axe Esionam ayein[647]
  And witen what thei wolden sein.
  So passeth he the See be barge[648]
  To Grece forto seie his charge,
  The which he seide redely
  Unto the lordes by and by:                                      7280

  Bot where he spak in Grece aboute,
  He herde noght bot wordes stoute,
  And nameliche of Thelamon;
  The maiden wolde he noght forgon,
  He seide, for no maner thing,
  And bad him gon hom to his king,
  For there gat he non amende
  For oght he couthe do or sende.
    This Anthenor ayein goth hom
  Unto his king, and whan he com,                                 7290
  He tolde in Grece of that he herde,
  And hou that Thelamon ansuerde,
  And hou thei were at here above,
  That thei wol nouther pes ne love,

  That he withouten eny lette
  A certein time scholde sette
  Of Parlement to ben avised:[650]
  And in the wise it was devised,
  Of parlement he sette a day,
  And that was in the Monthe of Maii.
  This Priamus hadde in his yhte
  A wif, and Hecuba sche hyhte,
  Be whom that time ek hadde he
  Of Sones fyve, and douhtres thre                                7310

  Of wommen whiche he hadde knowe;
  Such was the world at thilke throwe:
  So that he was of children riche,
  As therof was noman his liche.[652]
    Of Parlement the dai was come,
  Ther ben the lordes alle and some;                              7320

  Thei seten alle stille and herde,
  And tho spak every man aboute:
  Ther was alegged many a doute,
  And many a proud word spoke also;[653]
  Bot for the moste part as tho[654]
  Thei wisten noght what was the beste,
  Or forto werre or forto reste.                                  7330
  Bot he that was withoute fere,
  Hector, among the lordes there
  His tale tolde in such a wise,
  And seide, ‘Lordes, ye ben wise,
  Ye knowen this als wel as I,
  Above all othre most worthi[655]

  Which is the thridde parti evene
  Of al the world under the hevene;
  And we be bot of folk a fewe.
  So were it reson forto schewe[656]
  The peril, er we falle thrinne:
  Betre is to leve, than beginne
  Thing which as mai noght ben achieved;
  He is noght wys that fint him grieved,
  And doth so that his grief be more;

  For while that mi lif wol stonde,
  If that ye taken werre on honde,

  For unto me wel more it quemeth
  The werre certes than the pes;

    Whan Hector hath seid his avis,
  Next after him tho spak Paris,
  Which was his brother, and alleide
  What him best thoghte, and thus he seide:
  ‘Strong thing it is to soffre wrong,
  And suffre schame is more strong,

  And thei here grete wordes blowe

  And who that wole himself noght meke
  To pes, and list no reson take,
  Men sein reson him wol forsake:[659]

  For I have cawht a gret believe
  Upon a point I wol declare.

  Withinne a while out of mi weie

  And slep me cauhte, and on the gras
  Beside a welle I lay me doun
  To slepe, and in a visioun[664]                                 7410

  Sche wolde bringe unto myn hond
  Of al this Erthe the faireste;
  So that me thoghte it for the beste,
  To hire and yaf that Appel tho.
  Thus hope I wel, if that I go,                                  7430

  And al was holde bot a jape,
  So that the pourpos which was schape,
  Or were hem lief or were hem loth,[668]
  Was holde, and into Grece goth
  This Paris with his retenance.
  And as it fell upon his chance,
  Of Grece he londeth in an yle,
  And him was told the same whyle[669]                            7470
  Of folk which he began to freyne,
  Tho was in thyle queene Heleyne,                             (7650*)
  And ek of contres there aboute
  Of ladis many a lusti route,
  With mochel worthi poeple also.
  And why thei comen theder tho,

  For worschipe and for sacrifise
  That thei to Venus wolden make,
  As thei tofore hadde undertake,                                 7480
  Some of good will, some of beheste,
  For thanne was hire hihe feste
  Withinne a temple which was there.
    Whan Paris wiste what thei were,
  Anon he schop his ordinance
  To gon and don his obeissance
  To Venus on hire holi day,
  And dede upon his beste aray.
  With gret richesse he him behongeth,
  As it to such a lord belongeth,                                 7490
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 385=]
  He was noght armed natheles,
  Bot as it were in lond of pes,
  And thus he goth forth out of Schipe
  And takth with him his felaschipe:
  In such manere as I you seie
  Unto the temple he hield his weie.
    Tydinge, which goth overal
  To grete and smale, forth withal
  Com to the queenes Ere and tolde
  Hou Paris com, and that he wolde                                7500
  Do sacrifise to Venus:
  And whan sche herde telle thus,
  She thoghte, hou that it evere be,
  That sche wole him abyde and se.[670]
    Forth comth Paris with glad visage
  Into the temple on pelrinage,
  Wher unto Venus the goddesse
  He yifth and offreth gret richesse,
  And preith hir that he preie wolde.
  And thanne aside he gan beholde,[671]                           7510
  And sih wher that this ladi stod;
  And he forth in his freisshe mod
  Goth ther sche was and made hir chiere,
  As he wel couthe in his manere,
  That of his wordes such plesance
  Sche tok, that al hire aqueintance,
  Als ferforth as the herte lay,
  He stal er that he wente away.
  So goth he forth and tok his leve,
  And thoghte, anon as it was eve,                                7520
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 386=]
  He wolde don his Sacrilegge,
  That many a man it scholde abegge.                           (7700*)
    Whan he to Schipe ayein was come,
  To him he hath his conseil nome,
  And al devised the matiere
  In such a wise as thou schalt hiere.
  Withinne nyht al prively
  His men he warneth by and by,
  That thei be redy armed sone
  For certein thing which was to done:                            7530
  And thei anon ben redi alle,
  And ech on other gan to calle,
  And went hem out upon the stronde[672]
  And tok a pourpos ther alonde
  Of what thing that thei wolden do,[673]
  Toward the temple and forth thei go.
  So fell it, of devocion
  Heleine in contemplacion
  With many an other worthi wiht
  Was in the temple and wok al nyht,                              7540
  To bidde and preie unto thymage[674]
  Of Venus, as was thanne usage;
  So that Paris riht as him liste
  Into the temple, er thei it wiste,[675]
  Com with his men al sodeinly,
  And alle at ones sette ascry
  In hem whiche in the temple were,
  For tho was mochel poeple there;
  Bot of defense was no bote,
  So soffren thei that soffre mote.                               7550
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 387=]
    Paris unto the queene wente,
  And hire in bothe hise armes hente
  With him and with his felaschipe,
  And forth thei bere hire unto Schipe.[676]
  Up goth the Seil and forth thei wente,
  And such a wynd fortune hem sente,
  Til thei the havene of Troie cauhte;
  Where out of Schipe anon thei strauhte
  And gon hem forth toward the toun,
  The which cam with processioun                                  7560
  Ayein Paris to sen his preie.
  And every man began to seie
  To Paris and his felaschipe
  Al that thei couthen of worschipe;
  Was non so litel man in Troie,
  That he ne made merthe and joie
  Of that Paris hath wonne Heleine.
  Bot al that merthe is sorwe and peine
  To Helenus and to Cassaundre;
  For thei it token schame and sklaundre[677]                     7570
  And lost of al the comun grace,
  That Paris out of holi place                                 (7750*)
  Be Stelthe hath take a mannes wif,
  Wherof that he schal lese his lif
  And many a worthi man therto,
  And al the Cite be fordo,
  Which nevere schal be mad ayein.
  And so it fell, riht as thei sein,
  The Sacrilege which he wroghte
  Was cause why the Gregois soughte                               7580
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 388=]
  Unto the toun and it beleie,
  And wolden nevere parte aweie,
  Til what be sleihte and what be strengthe
  Thei hadde it wonne in brede and lengthe,
  And brent and slayn that was withinne.
  Now se, mi Sone, which a sinne
  Is Sacrilege in holy stede:
  Be war therfore and bidd thi bede,
  And do nothing in holy cherche,
  Bot that thou miht be reson werche.                             7590

  xiii. _Prodegus et parcus duo sunt extrema, que largus_[685]
          _Est horum medius, plebis in ore bonus._
      [Sidenote: Nota hic de virtute Largitatis, que ad oppositum
      Auaricie inter duo extrema, videlicet Parcimoniam et
      Prodegalitatem, specialiter consistit.]
    Betwen the tuo extremites
  Of vice stant the propretes
  Of vertu, and to prove it so
  Tak Avarice and tak also
  The vice of Prodegalite;
  Betwen hem Liberalite,
  Which is the vertu of Largesse,
  Stant and governeth his noblesse.
  For tho tuo vices in discord
  Stonde evere, as I finde of record;                             7650
  So that betwen here tuo debat
  Largesse reuleth his astat.
  For in such wise as Avarice,
  As I tofore have told the vice,
  Thurgh streit holdinge and thurgh skarsnesse
  Stant in contraire to Largesse,
  Riht so stant Prodegalite
  Revers, bot noght in such degre.
  For so as Avarice spareth,
  And forto kepe his tresor careth,                               7660
  That other al his oghne and more
  Ayein the wise mannes lore
  Yifth and despendeth hiere and there,
  So that him reccheth nevere where.
  While he mai borwe, he wol despende,
  Til ate laste he seith, ‘I wende’;
  Bot that is spoken al to late,
  For thanne is poverte ate gate
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 391=]
  And takth him evene be the slieve,
  For erst wol he no wisdom lieve.                                7670
  And riht as Avarice is Sinne,
  That wolde his tresor kepe and winne,                        (7850*)
  Riht so is Prodegalite:
  Bot of Largesse in his degre,
  Which evene stant betwen the tuo,
  The hihe god and man also
  The vertu ech of hem commendeth.
  For he himselven ferst amendeth,
  That overal his name spredeth,
  And to alle othre, where it nedeth,                             7680
  He yifth his good in such a wise,
  That he makth many a man arise,
  Which elles scholde falle lowe.
  Largesce mai noght ben unknowe;
  For what lond that he regneth inne,
  It mai noght faile forto winne
  Thurgh his decerte love and grace,
  Wher it schal faile in other place.
    And thus betwen tomoche and lyte[686]
  Largesce, which is noght to wyte,                               7690
  Halt evere forth the middel weie:
  Bot who that torne wole aweie
  Fro that to Prodegalite,
  Anon he lest the proprete[687]
  Of vertu and goth to the vice;
  For in such wise as Avarice
  Lest for scarsnesse his goode name,
  Riht so that other is to blame,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 392=]
  Which thurgh his wast mesure excedeth,
  For noman wot what harm that bredeth.[688]                      7700
    Bot mochel joie ther betydeth,[689]
  Wher that largesse an herte guydeth:
  For his mesure is so governed,
  That he to bothe partz is lerned,
  To god and to the world also,
  He doth reson to bothe tuo.
  The povere folk of his almesse
  Relieved ben in the destresse
  Of thurst, of hunger and of cold;
  The yifte of him was nevere sold,                               7710
  Bot frely yive, and natheles
  The myhti god of his encress
  Rewardeth him of double grace;
  The hevene he doth him to pourchace
  And yifth him ek the worldes good:
  And thus the Cote for the hod
  Largesse takth, and yit no Sinne
  He doth, hou so that evere he winne.
                              [Sidenote: Lucas. Omni habenti dabitur.]
    What man hath hors men yive him hors,
  And who non hath of him no fors,                                7720
  For he mai thanne on fote go;
  The world hath evere stonde so.
  Bot forto loken of the tweie,
  A man to go the siker weie,
                       [Sidenote: Beacius est dare quam accipere.[690]]
  Betre is to yive than to take:
  With yifte a man mai frendes make,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 393=]
  Bot who that takth or gret or smal,

  And stant noght fre til it be quit.
  So forto deme in mannes wit,                                    7730
  It helpeth more a man to have
  His oghne good, than forto crave
  Of othre men and make him bounde,
  Wher elles he mai stonde unbounde.
      [Sidenote: Seneca. Si res tue tibi non sufficiant, fac vt

    Senec conseileth in this wise,
  And seith, ‘Bot if thi good suffise
  Unto the liking of thi wille,
  Withdrawh thi lust and hold the stille,
  And be to thi good sufficant.’
      [Sidenote: Apostolus.[691] Ordinata caritas incipit a seipsa.]
  For that thing is appourtenant                                  7740
  To trouthe and causeth to be fre
  After the reule of charite,
  Which ferst beginneth of himselve.
  For if thou richest othre tuelve,
  Wherof thou schalt thiself be povere,
  I not what thonk thou miht recovere.
    Whil that a man hath good to yive,
  With grete routes he mai live
  And hath his frendes overal,
  And everich of him telle schal.                                 7750
  Therwhile he hath his fulle packe,[692]
  Thei seie, ‘A good felawe is Jacke’;
  Bot whanne it faileth ate laste,
  Anon his pris thei overcaste,
  For thanne is ther non other lawe
  Bot, ‘Jacke was a good felawe.’
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 394=]
  Whan thei him povere and nedy se,
  Thei lete him passe and farwel he;
  Al that he wende of compainie
  Is thanne torned to folie.                                      7760
                                  [Sidenote: [PRODIGALITY OF LOVERS.]]
    Bot nou to speke in other kinde
  Of love, a man mai suche finde,
  That wher thei come in every route
  Thei caste and waste her love aboute,
  Til al here time is overgon,
  And thanne have thei love non:[693]
  For who that loveth overal,
  It is no reson that he schal                                 (7900*)
  Of love have eny proprete.
  Forthi, mi Sone, avise thee                                     7770
  If thou of love hast be to large,
  For such a man is noght to charge:
  And if it so be that thou hast
  Despended al thi time in wast
  And set thi love in sondri place,
  Though thou the substance of thi grace
  Lese ate laste, it is no wonder;
  For he that put himselven under,
  As who seith, comun overal,
  He lest the love special                                        7780
  Of eny on, if sche be wys;
  For love schal noght bere his pris
  Be reson, whanne it passeth on.

  That were of love wel at ese,

  In sondri places wher thei wente.
                                                [Sidenote: Confessor.]
    Riht so, mi Sone, I axe of thee
  If thou with Prodegalite                                        7790
  Hast hier and ther thi love wasted.
                                                    [Sidenote: Amans.]
    Mi fader, nay; bot I have tasted
  In many a place as I have go,
  And yit love I nevere on of tho,
  Bot forto drive forth the dai.
  For lieveth wel, myn herte is ay
  Withoute mo for everemore
  Al upon on, for I nomore
  Desire bot hire love al one:
  So make I many a prive mone,                                    7800
  For wel I fiele I have despended
  Mi longe love and noght amended
  Mi sped, for oght I finde yit.
  If this be wast to youre wit[695]
  Of love, and Prodegalite,
  Nou, goode fader, demeth ye:
  Bot of o thing I wol me schryve,
  That I schal for no love thryve,
  Bot if hirself me wol relieve.[696]
                                                [Sidenote: Confessor.]
    Mi Sone, that I mai wel lieve:                                7810
  And natheles me semeth so,
  For oght that thou hast yit misdo
  Of time which thou hast despended,
  It mai with grace ben amended.
  For thing which mai be worth the cost
  Per chaunce is nouther wast ne lost;
                                              [Sidenote: =P. ii. 396=]
  For what thing stant on aventure,[697]
  That can no worldes creature                                 (7950*)
  Telle in certein hou it schal wende,[698]
  Til he therof mai sen an ende.                                  7820
  So that I not as yit therfore
  If thou, mi Sone, hast wonne or lore:
  For ofte time, as it is sene,[699]
  Whan Somer hath lost al his grene
  And is with Wynter wast and bare,
  That him is left nothing to spare,
  Al is recovered in a throwe;
  The colde wyndes overblowe,
  And stille be the scharpe schoures,[700]
  And soudeinliche ayein his floures                              7830
  The Somer hapneth and is riche:
  And so per cas thi graces liche,
  Mi Sone, thogh thou be nou povere
  Of love, yit thou miht recovere.
                                                    [Sidenote: Amans.]
    Mi fader, certes grant merci:
  Ye have me tawht so redeli,
  That evere whil I live schal
  The betre I mai be war withal
  Of thing which ye have seid er this.
  Bot overmore hou that it is,[701]                               7840
  Toward mi schrifte as it belongeth,
  To wite of othre pointz me longeth;
  Wherof that ye me wolden teche
  With al myn herte I you beseche.

  i. _Est gula que nostrum maculauit prima parentem_
       _Ex vetito pomo, quo dolet omnis homo._
     _Hec agit vt corpus anime contraria spirat,_
       _Quo caro fit crassa, spiritus atque macer._
     _Intus et exterius si que virtutis habentur,_
       _Potibus ebrietas conuiciata ruit._
     _Mersa sopore, labris, que Bachus inebriat hospes,_
       _Indignata Venus oscula raro premit._

    The grete Senne original,
  Which every man in general
  Upon his berthe hath envenymed,
      [Sidenote: Hic in sexto libro tractare intendit de illo

      habundancius augmentatur.]
  In Paradis it was mystymed:
  Whan Adam of thilke Appel bot,
  His swete morscel was to hot,
  Which dedly made the mankinde.
  And in the bokes as I finde,
  This vice, which so out of rule
  Hath sette ous alle, is cleped Gule;[702]                         10
                                               [Sidenote: =P. iii. 2=]
  Of which the branches ben so grete,
  That of hem alle I wol noght trete,
  Bot only as touchende of tuo[703]
  I thenke speke and of no mo;
                                         [Sidenote: [i. DRUNKENNESS.]]
  Wherof the ferste is Dronkeschipe,
  Which berth the cuppe felaschipe.
  Ful many a wonder doth this vice,
  He can make of a wisman nyce,
  And of a fool, that him schal seme
  That he can al the lawe deme,                                     20
  And yiven every juggement
  Which longeth to the firmament
  Bothe of the sterre and of the mone;
  And thus he makth a gret clerk sone
  Of him that is a lewed man.
  Ther is nothing which he ne can,
  Whil he hath Dronkeschipe on honde,
  He knowth the See, he knowth the stronde,
  He is a noble man of armes,
  And yit no strengthe is in his armes:                             30
  Ther he was strong ynouh tofore,
  With Dronkeschipe it is forlore,
  And al is changed his astat,
  And wext anon so fieble and mat,[704]
  That he mai nouther go ne come,
  Bot al togedre him is benome
  The pouer bothe of hond and fot,
  So that algate abide he mot.
  And alle hise wittes he foryet,
  The which is to him such a let,                                   40

  That he wot nevere what he doth,
  Ne which is fals, ne which is soth,
  Ne which is dai, ne which is nyht,
  And for the time he knowth no wyht,[705]
  That he ne wot so moche as this,
  What maner thing himselven is,
  Or he be man, or he be beste.
  That holde I riht a sori feste,
  Whan he that reson understod
  So soudeinliche is woxe wod,                                      50
  Or elles lich the dede man,
  Which nouther go ne speke can.
  Thus ofte he is to bedde broght,
  Bot where he lith yit wot he noght,
  Til he arise upon the morwe;
  And thanne he seith, ‘O, which a sorwe
  It is a man be drinkeles!’[706]
  So that halfdrunke in such a res
  With dreie mouth he sterte him uppe,[707]
  And seith, ‘Nou _baillez ça_ the cuppe.’                     60
  That made him lese his wit at eve
  Is thanne a morwe al his beleve;
  The cuppe is al that evere him pleseth,
  And also that him most deseseth;
  It is the cuppe whom he serveth,
  Which alle cares fro him kerveth[708]
  And alle bales to him bringeth:
  In joie he wepth, in sorwe he singeth,
  For Dronkeschipe is so divers,[709]
  It may no whyle stonde in vers.                                   70

  He drinkth the wyn, bot ate laste
  The wyn drynkth him and bint him faste,
  And leith him drunke be the wal,
  As him which is his bonde thral
  And al in his subjeccion.
                                       [Sidenote: [LOVE-DRUNKENNESS.]]
    And lich to such condicion,
  As forto speke it other wise,
  It falleth that the moste wise
  Ben otherwhile of love adoted,[710]
  And so bewhaped and assoted,                                      80
  Of drunke men that nevere yit
  Was non, which half so loste his wit
  Of drinke, as thei of such thing do
  Which cleped is the jolif wo;
  And waxen of here oghne thoght
  So drunke, that thei knowe noght[711]
  What reson is, or more or lesse.
  Such is the kinde of that sieknesse,
  And that is noght for lacke of brain,
  Bot love is of so gret a main,                                    90
  That where he takth an herte on honde,
  Ther mai nothing his miht withstonde:
  The wise Salomon was nome,
  And stronge Sampson overcome,
  The knihtli David him ne mihte
  Rescoue, that he with the sihte
  Of Bersabee ne was bestad,
  Virgile also was overlad,
  And Aristotle was put under.
  Forthi, mi Sone, it is no wonder                                 100
                                               [Sidenote: =P. iii. 5=]
  If thou be drunke of love among,[712]
  Which is above alle othre strong:
  And if so is that thou so be,
  Tell me thi Schrifte in privite;
  It is no schame of such a thew
  A yong man to be dronkelew.
  Of such Phisique I can a part,
  And as me semeth be that art,
  Thou scholdest be Phisonomie
  Be schapen to that maladie                                       110

    Ha, holi fader, al is trouthe
  That ye me telle: I am beknowe
  That I with love am so bethrowe,
  And al myn herte is so thurgh sunke,
  That I am verrailiche drunke,
  And yit I mai bothe speke and go.
  Bot I am overcome so,
  And torned fro miself so clene,
  That ofte I wot noght what I mene;                               120
  So that excusen I ne mai

  That I cam to mi ladi kiththe,
  I was yit sobre nevere siththe.
  Wher I hire se or se hire noght,
  With musinge of min oghne thoght,
  Of love, which min herte assaileth,
  So drunke I am, that mi wit faileth
  And al mi brain is overtorned,
  And mi manere so mistorned,                                      130

  That I foryete al that I can
  And stonde lich a mased man;
  That ofte, whanne I scholde pleie,
  It makth me drawe out of the weie
  In soulein place be miselve,
  As doth a labourer to delve,
  Which can no gentil mannes chere;
  Or elles as a lewed Frere,

  Riht so lese I mi contienance.                                   140
  And if it nedes so betyde,
  That I in compainie abyde,
  Wher as I moste daunce and singe

  Or forto go the newefot,[713]
  I mai noght wel heve up mi fot,

  I mai unethes gon the pas.[714]
  For thus it is and evere was,[715]
  Whanne I on suche thoghtes muse,
  The lust and merthe that men use,
  Whan I se noght mi ladi byme,
  Al is foryete for the time
  So ferforth that mi wittes changen
  And alle lustes fro me strangen,
  That thei seie alle trewely,
  And swere, that it am noght I.[716]                              160
                                               [Sidenote: =P. iii. 7=]
  For as the man which ofte drinketh,
  With win that in his stomac sinketh[717]
  Wext drunke and witles for a throwe,
  Riht so mi lust is overthrowe,
  And of myn oghne thoght so mat
  I wexe, that to myn astat
  Ther is no lime wol me serve,
  Bot as a drunke man I swerve,
  And suffre such a Passion,
  That men have gret compassion,                                   170
  And everich be himself merveilleth
  What thing it is that me so eilleth.[718]
  Such is the manere of mi wo
  Which time that I am hire fro,
  Til eft ayein that I hire se.
  Bot thanne it were a nycete
  To telle you hou that I fare:
  For whanne I mai upon hire stare,
  Hire wommanhede, hire gentilesse,
  Myn herte is full of such gladnesse,                             180
  That overpasseth so mi wit,
  That I wot nevere where it sit,
  Bot am so drunken of that sihte,
  Me thenkth that for the time I mihte
  Riht sterte thurgh the hole wall;
  And thanne I mai wel, if I schal,
  Bothe singe and daunce and lepe aboute,
  And holde forth the lusti route.
  Bot natheles it falleth so
  Fulofte, that I fro hire go                                      190

  Ne mai, bot as it were a stake,
  I stonde avisement to take
  And loke upon hire faire face;
  That for the while out of the place
  For al the world ne myhte I wende.
  Such lust comth thanne into mi mende,
  So that withoute mete or drinke,[719]
  Of lusti thoughtes whiche I thinke
  Me thenkth I mihte stonden evere;
  And so it were to me levere                                      200
  Than such a sihte forto leve,
  If that sche wolde yif me leve[720]
  To have so mochel of mi wille.
  And thus thenkende I stonde stille
  Withoute blenchinge of myn yhe,
  Riht as me thoghte that I syhe
  Of Paradis the moste joie:
  And so therwhile I me rejoie,
  Into myn herte a gret desir,[721]
  The which is hotere than the fyr,                                210
  Al soudeinliche upon me renneth,
  That al mi thoght withinne brenneth,
  And am so ferforth overcome,
  That I not where I am become;
  So that among the hetes stronge[722]
  In stede of drinke I underfonge
  A thoght so swete in mi corage,
  That nevere Pyment ne vernage
  Was half so swete forto drinke.
  For as I wolde, thanne I thinke                                  220
                                               [Sidenote: =P. iii. 9=]
  As thogh I were at myn above,
  For so thurgh drunke I am of love,
  That al that mi sotye demeth
  Is soth, as thanne it to me semeth.
  And whyle I mai tho thoghtes kepe,
  Me thenkth as thogh I were aslepe
  And that I were in goddes barm;
  Bot whanne I se myn oghne harm,
  And that I soudeinliche awake
  Out of my thought, and hiede take                                230
  Hou that the sothe stant in dede,
  Thanne is mi sekernesse in drede
  And joie torned into wo,
  So that the hete is al ago
  Of such sotie as I was inne.[723]
  And thanne ayeinward I beginne
  To take of love a newe thorst,
  The which me grieveth altherworst,
  For thanne comth the blanche fievere,
  With chele and makth me so to chievere,                          240
  And so it coldeth at myn herte,[724]
  That wonder is hou I asterte,[725]
  In such a point that I ne deie:
  For certes ther was nevere keie
  Ne frosen ys upon the wal
  More inly cold than I am al.
  And thus soffre I the hote chele,
  Which passeth othre peines fele;
  In cold I brenne and frese in hete:
  And thanne I drinke a biter swete                                250
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 10=]
  With dreie lippe and yhen wete.
  Lo, thus I tempre mi diete,
  And take a drauhte of such reles,
  That al mi wit is herteles,
  And al myn herte, ther it sit,
  Is, as who seith, withoute wit;
  So that to prove it be reson
  In makinge of comparison
  Ther mai no difference be
  Betwen a drunke man and me.                                      260
  Bot al the worste of everychon
  Is evere that I thurste in on;[726]
  The more that myn herte drinketh,
  The more I may; so that me thinketh,
  My thurst schal nevere ben aqueint.
  God schilde that I be noght dreint
  Of such a superfluite:
  For wel I fiele in mi degre
  That al mi wit is overcast,
  Wherof I am the more agast,                                      270
  That in defaulte of ladischipe

  I mai be ded er I be war.
  For certes, fader, this I dar
  Beknowe and in mi schrifte telle:
  Bot I a drauhte have of that welle,
  In which mi deth is and mi lif,
  Mi joie is torned into strif,
  That sobre schal I nevere worthe,
  Bot as a drunke man forworthe;                                   280
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 11=]
  So that in londe where I fare[727]
  The lust is lore of mi welfare,
  As he that mai no bote finde.
  Bot this me thenkth a wonder kinde,
  As I am drunke of that I drinke,[728]
  So am I ek for falte of drinke;
  Of which I finde no reles:
  Bot if I myhte natheles
  Of such a drinke as I coveite,
  So as me liste, have o receite,                                  290
  I scholde assobre and fare wel.
  Bot so fortune upon hire whiel
  On hih me deigneth noght to sette,
  For everemore I finde a lette:
  The boteler is noght mi frend,
  Which hath the keie be the bend;
  I mai wel wisshe and that is wast,[729]
  For wel I wot, so freissh a tast,
  Bot if mi grace be the more,
  I schal assaie neveremore.                                       300
  Thus am I drunke of that I se,
  For tastinge is defended me,
  And I can noght miselven stanche:
  So that, mi fader, of this branche
  I am gultif, to telle trouthe.

  As for the time yit it lisseth
  To him which other joie misseth.
  Forthi, mi Sone, aboven alle

  And kep thi wittes that thou hast,
  And let hem noght be drunke in wast:
  Bot natheles ther is no wyht
  That mai withstonde loves miht.
  Bot why the cause is, as I finde,
  Of that ther is diverse kinde                                    320
  Of lovedrunke, why men pleigneth
  After the court which al ordeigneth,

  Ther myhte thei no drinke finde
  Of water nor of other kinde,
  So that himself and al his host
  Were of defalte of drinke almost[743]
  Destruid, and thanne Bachus preide
  To Jupiter, and thus he seide:
  ‘O hihe fader, that sest al,
  To whom is reson that I schal
  Beseche and preie in every nede,
  Behold, mi fader, and tak hiede                                  420

  To staunche, and grante ous forto winne,
  And sauf unto the contre fare,
  Wher that oure lusti loves are
  Waitende upon oure hom cominge.’
  And with the vois of his preiynge,
  Which herd was to the goddes hihe,
  He syh anon tofore his yhe
  A wether, which the ground hath sporned;
  And wher he hath it overtorned,                                  430
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 16=]
  Ther sprang a welle freissh and cler,
  Wherof his oghne boteler
  After the lustes of his wille
  Was every man to drinke his fille.[745]
  And for this ilke grete grace

  A riche temple let arere,
  Which evere scholde stonde there
  To thursti men in remembrance.

  And thenke hem mor delicious
  Than he hath in his oghne hous:

  Avise hem wel, thei that so do.
  And forto speke in other weie,
  Fulofte time I have herd seie,
  That he which hath no love achieved,
  Him thenkth that he is noght relieved,
  Thogh that his ladi make him chiere,

  Ne was I nevere yit gultif;

  Of wif, or yit of other love,                                    700
  I faste, and mai no fode gete;
  So that for lacke of deinte mete,
  Of which an herte mai be fedd,
  I go fastende to my bedd.
  Bot myhte I geten, as ye tolde,
  So mochel that mi ladi wolde

  Bot certes, fader, sche ne doth;
  For in good feith, to telle soth,
  I trowe, thogh I scholde sterve,
  Sche wolde noght hire yhe swerve,
  Min herte with o goodly lok[778]
  To fede, and thus for such a cok

  Therof I have at every meel                                      720
  Of plente more than ynowh;
  Bot that is of himself so towh,

  Of love, which myn herte fedeth;
  Thus have I lacke of that me nedeth.
    Bot for al this yit natheles
  I seie noght I am gylteles,
  That I somdel am delicat:
  For elles were I fulli mat,                                      730
  Bot if that I som lusti stounde

  Hou that mi fodes ben diverse,
  So as thei fallen in degre.
  O fiedinge is of that I se,[780]
  An other is of that I here,
  The thridde, as I schal tellen here,
  It groweth of min oghne thoght:
  And elles scholde I live noght;                                  750
  For whom that failleth fode of herte,[781]
  He mai noght wel the deth asterte.
    Of sihte is al mi ferste fode,

  Hath that to him is acordant,
  A lusti fode sufficant.
  Whan that I go toward the place
  Wher I schal se my ladi face,
  Min yhe, which is loth to faste,
  Beginth to hungre anon so faste,                                 760
  That him thenkth of on houre thre,
  Til I ther come and he hire se:[782]
  And thanne after his appetit
  He takth a fode of such delit,
  That him non other deynte nedeth.
  Of sondri sihtes he him fedeth:
  He seth hire face of such colour,
  That freisshere is than eny flour,
  He seth hire front is large and plein
  Withoute fronce of eny grein,                                    770
  He seth hire yhen lich an hevene,
  He seth hire nase strauht and evene,
  He seth hire rode upon the cheke,
  He seth hire rede lippes eke,
  Hire chyn acordeth to the face,
  Al that he seth is full of grace,
  He seth hire necke round and clene,
  Therinne mai no bon be sene,
  He seth hire handes faire and whyte;
  For al this thing without wyte                                   780
  He mai se naked ate leste,
  So is it wel the more feste
  And wel the mor Delicacie
  Unto the fiedinge of myn yhe.[783]
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 28=]
  He seth hire schapthe forth withal,[784]
  Hire bodi round, hire middel smal,
  So wel begon with good array,
  Which passeth al the lust of Maii,
  Whan he is most with softe schoures
  Ful clothed in his lusti floures.                                790
  With suche sihtes by and by
  Min yhe is fed; bot finaly,
  Whan he the port and the manere
  Seth of hire wommanysshe chere,
  Than hath he such delice on honde,
  Him thenkth he mihte stille stonde,
  And that he hath ful sufficance
  Of liflode and of sustienance
  As to his part for everemo.
  And if it thoghte alle othre so,                                 800
  Fro thenne wolde he nevere wende,
  Bot there unto the worldes ende
  He wolde abyde, if that he mihte,
  And fieden him upon the syhte.
  For thogh I mihte stonden ay
  Into the time of domesday
  And loke upon hire evere in on,
  Yit whanne I scholde fro hire gon,
  Min yhe wolde, as thogh he faste,
  Ben hungerstorven al so faste,                                   810
  Til efte ayein that he hire syhe.
  Such is the nature of myn yhe:
  Ther is no lust so deintefull,
  Of which a man schal noght be full,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 29=]
  Of that the stomac underfongeth,
  Bot evere in on myn yhe longeth:
  For loke hou that a goshauk tireth,
  Riht so doth he, whan that he pireth
  And toteth on hire wommanhiede;
  For he mai nevere fulli fiede                                    820
  His lust, bot evere aliche sore
  Him hungreth, so that he the more
  Desireth to be fed algate:
  And thus myn yhe is mad the gate,
  Thurgh which the deyntes of my thoght
  Of lust ben to myn herte broght.
    Riht as myn yhe with his lok[785]
  Is to myn herte a lusti coc
  Of loves fode delicat,
                       [Sidenote: Qualiter auris in amore delectatur.]
  Riht so myn Ere in his astat,                                    830
  Wher as myn yhe mai noght serve,
  Can wel myn hertes thonk deserve
  And fieden him fro day to day
  With suche deyntes as he may.
  For thus it is, that overal,
  Wher as I come in special,
  I mai hiere of mi ladi pris;
  I hiere on seith that sche is wys,[786]
  An other seith that sche is good,
  And som men sein, of worthi blod                                 840
  That sche is come, and is also[787]
  So fair, that nawher is non so;
  And som men preise hire goodli chiere:
  Thus every thing that I mai hiere,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 30=]
  Which souneth to mi ladi goode,
  Is to myn Ere a lusti foode.
  And ek min Ere hath over this
  A deynte feste, whan so is
  That I mai hiere hirselve speke;
  For thanne anon mi faste I breke                                 850
  On suche wordes as sche seith,
  That full of trouthe and full of feith
  Thei ben, and of so good desport,
  That to myn Ere gret confort
  Thei don, as thei that ben delices.
  For al the metes and the spices,[788]
  That eyn Lombard couthe make,
  Ne be so lusti forto take
  Ne so ferforth restauratif,
  I seie as for myn oghne lif,                                     860
  As ben the wordes of hire mouth:
  For as the wyndes of the South
  Ben most of alle debonaire,
  So whan hir list to speke faire,
  The vertu of hire goodly speche
  Is verraily myn hertes leche.
  And if it so befalle among,
  That sche carole upon a song,
  Whan I it hiere I am so fedd,
  That I am fro miself so ledd,                                    870
  As thogh I were in paradis;
  For certes, as to myn avis,
  Whan I here of hir vois the stevene,
  Me thenkth it is a blisse of hevene.
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 31=]
    And ek in other wise also
  Fulofte time it falleth so,
  Min Ere with a good pitance
  Is fedd of redinge of romance
  Of Ydoine and of Amadas,
  That whilom weren in mi cas,                                     880
  And eke of othre many a score,
  That loveden longe er I was bore.
  For whan I of here loves rede,
  Min Ere with the tale I fede;
  And with the lust of here histoire
  Somtime I drawe into memoire
  Hou sorwe mai noght evere laste;
  And so comth hope in ate laste,
  Whan I non other fode knowe.
  And that endureth bot a throwe,                                  890
  Riht as it were a cherie feste;
  Bot forto compten ate leste,[789]
  As for the while yit it eseth
  And somdel of myn herte appeseth:
  For what thing to myn Ere spreedeth,
  Which is plesant, somdel it feedeth
  With wordes suche as he mai gete
  Mi lust, in stede of other mete.

    Lo thus, mi fader, as I seie,[790]
  Of lust the which myn yhe hath seie,                             900
  And ek of that myn Ere hath herd,
  Fulofte I have the betre ferd.
  And tho tuo bringen in the thridde,

  Whan that me lacketh alle sihtes,
  And that myn heringe is aweie,
  Thanne is he redy in the weie                                    910
  Mi reresouper forto make,
  Of which myn hertes fode I take.
    This lusti cokes name is hote
  Thoght, which hath evere hise pottes hote
      [Sidenote: Qualiter cogitatus impressiones leticie

  Of love buillende on the fyr
  With fantasie and with desir,
  Of whiche er this fulofte he fedde
  Min herte, whanne I was abedde;
  And thanne he set upon my bord
  Bothe every syhte and every word                                 920
  Of lust, which I have herd or sein.
  Bot yit is noght mi feste al plein,
  Bot al of woldes and of wisshes,
  Therof have I my fulle disshes,
  Bot as of fielinge and of tast,
  Yit mihte I nevere have o repast.
  And thus, as I have seid aforn,[792]
  I licke hony on the thorn,[793]
  And as who seith, upon the bridel
  I chiewe, so that al is ydel                                     930
  As in effect the fode I have.
  Bot as a man that wolde him save,

  Withoute tastinge or fielinge:
  And as the Plover doth of Eir

  That for no such delicacie

  The bodely delices alle
  In every point, hou so thei falle,

  And forto take in remembrance,                                   970
  A tale acordant unto this,
  Which of gret understondinge is
  To mannes soule resonable,[796]
  I thenke telle, and is no fable.

  And thogh the clerk and the clergesse                            980
  In latin tunge it rede and singe,
  Yit for the more knoulechinge
  Of trouthe, which is good to wite,
  I schal declare as it is write
  In Engleissh, for thus it began.
    Crist seith: ‘Ther was a riche man,
  A mihti lord of gret astat,
  And he was ek so delicat[798]
  Of his clothing, that everyday
  Of pourpre and bisse he made him gay,                            990
  And eet and drank therto his fille
  After the lustes of his wille,
  As he which al stod in delice[799]
  And tok non hiede of thilke vice.

  And as it scholde so betyde,
  A povere lazre upon a tyde
  Cam to the gate and axed mete:
  Bot there mihte he nothing gete[800]
  His dedly hunger forto stanche;
  For he, which hadde his fulle panche                            1000
  Of alle lustes ate bord,
  Ne deigneth noght to speke a word,
  Onliche a Crumme forto yive,
  Wherof the povere myhte live[801]
  Upon the yifte of his almesse.
  Thus lai this povere in gret destresse[802]
  Acold and hungred ate gate,
  Fro which he mihte go no gate,[803]
  So was he wofulli besein.
  And as these holi bokes sein,[804]                              1010
  The houndes comen fro the halle,
  Wher that this sike man was falle,
  And as he lay ther forto die,
  The woundes of his maladie
  Thei licken forto don him ese.
  Bot he was full of such desese,
  That he mai noght the deth eschape;
  Bot as it was that time schape,
  The Soule fro the bodi passeth,
  And he whom nothing overpasseth,                                1020

  The fend into the fyr him drouh,
  Wher that he hadde peine ynouh
  Of flamme which that evere brenneth.

  Toward the hevene he cast his lok,
  Wher that he syh and hiede tok

  “Send Lazar doun fro thilke Sete,
  And do that he his finger wete
  In water, so that he mai droppe
  Upon my tunge, forto stoppe

  Bot Habraham answerde thenne
  And seide to him in this wise:
  “Mi Sone, thou thee miht avise[808]

  Hou Lazar hadde gret penance,                                   1050
  Whyl he was in that other lif,

  In hevene and hath his lif begonne                              1060
  Of joie, which is endeles.
  Bot that thou preidest natheles,
  That I schal Lazar to the sende
  With water on his finger ende,

  Thou schalt no suche graces fiele;
  For to that foule place of Sinne,

  Thus be yee parted nou atuo.”
    The riche ayeinward cride tho:
  “O Habraham, sithe it so is,
  That Lazar mai noght do me this
  Which I have axed in this place,
  I wolde preie an other grace.
  For I have yit of brethren fyve,

  This tale, as Crist himself it tolde,
  Thou schalt have cause to beholde,[816]
  To se so gret an evidence,

  Hath schewed openliche at ÿe,

  Of him which yeveth non almesse

  For he ne wolde unto his liche                                  1120
  A Crumme yiven of his bred,
  Thanne afterward, whan he was ded,
  A drope of water him was werned.
  Thus mai a mannes wit be lerned
  Of hem that so delices taken;
  Whan thei with deth ben overtaken,
  That erst was swete is thanne sour.
  Bot he that is a governour
  Of worldes good, if he be wys,
  Withinne his herte he set no pris                               1130
  Of al the world, and yit he useth
  The good, that he nothing refuseth,
  As he which lord is of the thinges.
  The Nouches and the riche ringes,
  The cloth of gold and the Perrie
  He takth, and yit delicacie
  He leveth, thogh he were al this.

  Of whom the Cronique is so plein,

  And natheles for glotonie
  Of bodili Delicacie,

  Of that noman tofore herde,
  Which he withinne himself bethoghte,
  A wonder soubtil thing he wroghte.

  Of age and of complexioun
  Lich to himself be alle weie
  He tok towardes him to pleie,                                   1170

  Therof was no diversite;

  Withinne a time at after mete
  Nero, which hadde noght foryete
  The lustes of his frele astat,
  As he which al was delicat,
  To knowe thilke experience,
  The men let come in his presence:[820]
  And to that on the same tyde,
  A courser that he scholde ryde
  Into the feld, anon he bad;
  Wherof this man was wonder glad,                                1190
  And goth to prike and prance aboute.
  That other, whil that he was oute,
  He leide upon his bedd to slepe:
  The thridde, which he wolde kepe
  Withinne his chambre, faire and softe
  He goth now doun nou up fulofte,
  Walkende a pass, that he ne slepte,
  Til he which on the courser lepte
  Was come fro the field ayein.
  Nero thanne, as the bokes sein,                                 1200
  These men doth taken alle thre
  And slouh hem, for he wolde se
  The whos stomak was best defied:
  And whanne he hath the sothe tryed,

  Which afterward he usede ay.
    And thus what thing unto his pay
  Was most plesant, he lefte non:[821]
  With every lust he was begon,                                   1210
  Wherof the bodi myhte glade,
  For he non abstinence made;
  Bot most above alle erthli thinges
  Of wommen unto the likinges

  For that lust scholde him noght asterte.
  Whan that the thurst of love him cawhte,
  Wher that him list he tok a drauhte,
  He spareth nouther wif ne maide,
  That such an other, as men saide,                               1220
  In al this world was nevere yit.

  Of al that ye have spoken hiere
  Which toucheth unto this matiere,
  To telle soth riht as I wene,
  I wot noght o word what ye mene.
  I wol noght seie, if that I couthe,
  That I nolde in mi lusti youthe
  Benethe in helle and ek above
  To winne with mi ladi love
  Don al that evere that I mihte;
  For therof have I non insihte                                   1370
  Wher afterward that I become,
  To that I wonne and overcome
  Hire love, which I most coveite.

    Mi Sone, that goth wonder streite:
  For this I mai wel telle soth,
  Ther is noman the which so doth,
  For al the craft that he can caste,
  That he nabeith it ate laste.
  For often he that wol beguile
  Is guiled with the same guile,                                  1380

  As I finde in a bok compiled
  To this matiere an old histoire,

  And is of gret essamplerie

  Wherof non ende mai be good.

  Of Surgerie he knew the cures.
  Bot somwhat of his aventures,
  Which schal to mi matiere acorde,
  Ter thee, mi Sone, I wol recorde.
    This king, of which thou hast herd sein,
  Fro Troie as he goth hom ayein
  Be Schipe, he fond the See divers,
  With many a wyndi storm revers.
  Bot he thurgh wisdom that he schapeth[838]
  Ful many a gret peril ascapeth,                                 1420
  Of whiche I thenke tellen on,
  Hou that malgre the nedle and ston
  Wynddrive he was al soudeinly
  Upon the strondes of Cilly,
  Wher that he moste abyde a whyle.
  Tuo queenes weren in that yle
  Calipsa named and Circes;
  And whan they herde hou Uluxes
  Is londed ther upon the ryve,
  For him thei senden als so blive.                               1430
  With him suche as he wolde he nam
  And to the court to hem he cam.[839]
  Thes queenes were as tuo goddesses
  Of Art magique Sorceresses,
  That what lord comth to that rivage,
  Thei make him love in such a rage
  And upon hem assote so,[840]
  That thei wol have, er that he go,
  Al that he hath of worldes good.
  Uluxes wel this understod,                                      1440

  Thei couthe moche, he couthe more;
  Thei schape and caste ayein him sore[841]
  And wroghte many a soutil wyle,
  Bot yit thei mihte him noght beguile.[842]
  Bot of the men of his navie

  Bot that Art couthe thei noght finde,
  Of which Uluxes was deceived,
  That he ne hath hem alle weyved,
  And broght hem into such a rote,
  That upon him thei bothe assote;
  And thurgh the science of his art
  He tok of hem so wel his part,                                  1460
  That he begat Circes with childe.
  He kepte him sobre and made hem wilde,

  Who that therof be lief or loth,
  Al quit into his Schip he goth.

  A betre wif ther mai non be,
  And yit ther ben ynowhe of goode.

  That sche was on of al the beste.[844]
  Wel myhte he sette his herte in reste,
  This king, whan he hir fond in hele;
  For as he couthe in wisdom dele,
  So couthe sche in wommanhiede:
  And whan sche syh withoute drede
  Hire lord upon his oghne ground,
  That he was come sauf and sound,
  In al this world ne mihte be[845]
  A gladdere womman than was sche.                                1490
    The fame, which mai noght ben hidd,
  Thurghout the lond is sone kidd,
  Here king is come hom ayein:
  Ther mai noman the fulle sein,
  Hou that thei weren alle glade,
  So mochel joie of him thei made.
  The presens every day be newed,
  He was with yiftes al besnewed;
  The poeple was of him so glad,
  That thogh non other man hem bad,                               1500
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 52=]
  Taillage upon hemself thei sette,
  And as it were of pure dette
  Thei yeve here goodes to the king:
  This was a glad hom welcomyng.
  Thus hath Uluxes what he wolde,
  His wif was such as sche be scholde,
  His poeple was to him sougit,
  Him lacketh nothing of delit.
    Bot fortune is of such a sleyhte,
  That whan a man is most on heyhte,[846]                         1510
  Sche makth him rathest forto falle:

  The happes over mannes hed
  Ben honged with a tendre thred.
  That proved was on Uluxes;
  For whan he was most in his pes,[848]
  Fortune gan to make him werre
  And sette his welthe al out of herre.[849]
  Upon a dai as he was merie,
  As thogh ther mihte him nothing derie,[850]                     1520
  Whan nyht was come, he goth to bedde,
  With slep and bothe his yhen fedde.
  And while he slepte, he mette a swevene:
  Him thoghte he syh a stature evene,[851]
  Which brihtere than the sonne schon;
  A man it semeth was it non,
  Bot yit it was as in figure
  Most lich to mannyssh creature,
  Bot as of beaute hevenelich
  It was most to an Angel lich:                                   1530
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 53=]
  And thus betwen angel and man
  Beholden it this king began,
  And such a lust tok of the sihte,
  That fain he wolde, if that he mihte,
  The forme of that figure embrace;
  And goth him forth toward the place,[852]
  Wher he sih that ymage tho,
  And takth it in his Armes tuo,
  And it embraceth him ayein
  And to the king thus gan it sein:                               1540
  ‘Uluxes, understand wel this,
  The tokne of oure aqueintance is
  Hierafterward to mochel tene:
  The love that is ous betuene,
  Of that we nou such joie make,
  That on of ous the deth schal take,
  Whan time comth of destine;
  It may non other wise be.’
  Uluxes tho began to preie
  That this figure wolde him seie                                 1550
  What wyht he is that seith him so.
  This wyht upon a spere tho
  A pensel which was wel begon,
  Embrouded, scheweth him anon:
  Thre fisshes alle of o colour
  In manere as it were a tour
  Upon the pensel were wroght.
  Uluxes kneu this tokne noght,
  And preith to wite in som partie
  What thing it myhte signefie,                                   1560

  ‘A signe it is,’ the wyht ansuerde,
  ‘Of an Empire:’ and forth he ferde
  Al sodeinly, whan he that seide.
    Uluxes out of slep abreide,
  And that was riht ayein the day,
  That lengere slepen he ne may.
      [Sidenote: Bernardus. Plures plura sciunt[853] et seipsos

  Men sein, a man hath knowleching[854]
  Save of himself of alle thing;
  His oghne chance noman knoweth,
  Bot as fortune it on him throweth:                              1570
  Was nevere yit so wys a clerk,
  Which mihte knowe al goddes werk,
  Ne the secret which god hath set
  Ayein a man mai noght be let.
  Uluxes, thogh that he be wys,
  With al his wit in his avis,
  The mor that he his swevene acompteth,
  The lasse he wot what it amonteth:
  For al his calculacion,
  He seth no demonstracion                                        1580
  Al pleinly forto knowe an ende;[855]
  Bot natheles hou so it wende,
  He dradde him of his oghne Sone.
  That makth him wel the more astone,
  And schop therfore anon withal,
  So that withinne castel wall
  Thelamachum his Sone he schette,
  And upon him strong warde he sette.
  The sothe furthere he ne knew,
  Til that fortune him overthreu;                                 1590
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 55=]
  Bot natheles for sikernesse,
  Wher that he mihte wite and gesse
  A place strengest in his lond,
  Ther let he make of lym and sond
  A strengthe where he wolde duelle;
  Was nevere man yit herde telle
  Of such an other as it was.
  And forto strengthe him in that cas,[856]
  Of al his lond the sekereste
  Of servantz and the worthieste,                                 1600
  To kepen him withinne warde,
  He sette his bodi forto warde;[857]
  And made such an ordinance,
  For love ne for aqueintance,
  That were it erly, were it late,
  Thei scholde lete in ate gate
  No maner man, what so betydde,
  Bot if so were himself it bidde.
    Bot al that myhte him noght availe,
  For whom fortune wole assaile,                                  1610
  Ther mai be non such resistence,
  Which mihte make a man defence;
  Al that schal be mot falle algate.
  This Circes, which I spak of late,
  On whom Uluxes hath begete
  A child, thogh he it have foryete,
  Whan time com, as it was wone,
  Sche was delivered of a Sone,
  Which cleped is Thelogonus.
  This child, whan he was bore thus,                              1620

  Aboute his moder to ful age,
  That he can reson and langage,
  In good astat was drawe forth:
  And whan he was so mochel worth
  To stonden in a mannes stede,
  Circes his moder hath him bede
  That he schal to his fader go,
  And tolde him al togedre tho
  What man he was that him begat.
  And whan Thelogonus of that                                     1630
  Was war and hath ful knowleching[858]
  Hou that his fader was a king,
  He preith his moder faire this,
  To go wher that his fader is;
  And sche him granteth that he schal,
  And made him redi forth withal.
  It was that time such usance,
  That every man the conoiscance
  Of his contre bar in his hond,
  Whan he wente into strange lond;                                1640
  And thus was every man therfore
  Wel knowe, wher that he was bore:
  For espiaile and mistrowinges
  They dede thanne suche thinges,
  That every man mai other knowe.[859]
  So it befell that ilke throwe
  Thelogonus as in this cas;
  Of his contre the signe was
  Thre fisshes, whiche he scholde bere
  Upon the penon of a spere:                                      1650
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 57=]
  And whan that he was thus arraied
  And hath his harneis al assaied,
  That he was redy everydel,
  His moder bad him farewel,
  And seide him that he scholde swithe
  His fader griete a thousand sithe.
    Thelogonus his moder kiste
  And tok his leve, and wher he wiste
  His fader was, the weie nam,
  Til he unto Nachaie cam,                                        1660
  Which of that lond the chief Cite
  Was cleped, and ther axeth he
  Wher was the king and hou he ferde.
  And whan that he the sothe herde,
  Wher that the king Uluxes was,
  Al one upon his hors gret pas
  He rod him forth, and in his hond
  He bar the signal of his lond
  With fisshes thre, as I have told;[860]
  And thus he wente unto that hold,                               1670
  Wher that his oghne fader duelleth.
  The cause why he comth he telleth
  Unto the kepers of the gate,
  And wolde have comen in therate,
  Bot schortli thei him seide nay:
  And he als faire as evere he may
  Besoghte and tolde hem ofte this,
  Hou that the king his fader is;
  Bot they with proude wordes grete
  Begunne to manace and threte,[861]                              1680
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 58=]
  Bot he go fro the gate faste,
  Thei wolde him take and sette faste.
  Fro wordes unto strokes thus
  Thei felle, and so Thelogonus
  Was sore hurt and welnyh ded;
  Bot with his scharpe speres hed
  He makth defence, hou so it falle,
  And wan the gate upon hem alle,
  And hath slain of the beste fyve;
  And thei ascriden als so blyve                                  1690
  Thurghout the castell al aboute.[862]
    On every syde men come oute,
  Wherof the kinges herte afflihte,
  And he with al the haste he mihte
  A spere cauhte and out he goth,[863]
  As he that was nyh wod for wroth.[864]
  He sih the gates ful of blod,
  Thelogonus and wher he stod
  He sih also, bot he ne knew
  What man it was, and to him threw[865]                          1700
  His Spere, and he sterte out asyde.
  Bot destine, which schal betide,
  Befell that ilke time so,
  Thelogonus knew nothing tho
  What man it was that to him caste,
  And while his oghne spere laste,
  With al the signe therupon
  He caste unto the king anon,
  And smot him with a dedly wounde.
  Uluxes fell anon to grounde;                                    1710
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 59=]
  Tho every man, ‘The king! the king!’
  Began to crie, and of this thing
  Thelogonus, which sih the cas,
  On knes he fell and seide, ‘Helas!
  I have min oghne fader slain:
  Nou wolde I deie wonder fain,[866]
  Nou sle me who that evere wile,
  For certes it is riht good skile.’[867]
  He crith, he wepth, he seith therfore,
  ‘Helas; that evere was I bore,                                  1720
  That this unhappi destine
  So wofulli comth in be me!’
  This king, which yit hath lif ynouh,
  His herte ayein to him he drouh,
  And to that vois an Ere he leide
  And understod al that he seide,
  And gan to speke, and seide on hih;
  ‘Bring me this man.’ And whan he sih
  Thelogonus, his thoght he sette
  Upon the swevene which he mette,                                1730
  And axeth that he myhte se
  His spere, on which the fisshes thre
  He sih upon a pensel wroght.[868]
  Tho wiste he wel it faileth noght,
  And badd him that he telle scholde[869]
  Fro whenne he cam and what he wolde.
    Thelogonus in sorghe and wo
  So as he mihte tolde tho
  Unto Uluxes al the cas,
  Hou that Circes his moder was,                                  1740
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 60=]
  And so forth seide him everydel,
  Hou that his moder gret him wel,
  And in what wise sche him sente.
  Tho wiste Uluxes what it mente,
  And tok him in hise Armes softe,
  And al bledende he kest him ofte,[870]
  And seide, ‘Sone, whil I live,
  This infortune I thee foryive.’
  After his other Sone in haste
  He sende, and he began him haste                                1750
  And cam unto his fader tyt.
  Bot whan he sih him in such plit,
  He wolde have ronne upon that other
  Anon, and slain his oghne brother,
  Ne hadde be that Uluxes
  Betwen hem made acord and pes,
  And to his heir Thelamachus
  He bad that he Thelogonus
  With al his pouer scholde kepe,
  Til he were of his woundes depe                                 1760
  Al hol, and thanne he scholde him yive
  Lond wher upon he mihte live.
  Thelamachus, whan he this herde,
  Unto his fader he ansuerde
  And seide he wolde don his wille.
  So duelle thei togedre stille,
  These brethren, and the fader sterveth.
    Lo, wherof Sorcerie serveth.

  As sche that guile non supposeth;
  And of tuo pointz sche him opposeth.
  On was, if that this god nomore
  Wol come ayein, and overmore,                                   2110
  Hou sche schal stonden in acord

  Tok forth a ring, wherinne a ston[901]
  Was set, and grave therupon
  A Sonne, in which, whan he cam nyh,

  And sigheth for his wyves sake,

  And hath gret wonder what it mente.[904]
    With that he hasteth him to ryse
  Anon, and sende after the wise,
  Among the whiche ther was on,
  A clerc, his name is Amphion:                                   2160

  And gete a Sone, which schal winne
  The world and al that is withinne.
  As leon is the king of bestes,

  Als ferr as schyneth eny Sonne.’                                2170

  Into an Egle he gan transforme,                                 2200
  And flyh and sette him on a raile;
  Wherof the king hath gret mervaile,
  For there he pruneth him and piketh,
  As doth an hauk whan him wel liketh,
  And after that himself he schok,
  Wherof that al the halle quok,
  As it a terremote were;
  Thei seiden alle, god was there:
  In such a res and forth he flyh.
    The king, which al this wonder syh,                           2210
  Whan he cam to his chambre alone,
  Unto the queene he made his mone[905]
  And of foryivenesse hir preide;
  For thanne he knew wel, as he seide,
  Sche was with childe with a godd.
  Thus was the king withoute rodd
  Chastised, and the queene excused
  Of that sche hadde ben accused.
  And for the gretere evidence,
  Yit after that in the presence                                  2220
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 76=]
  Of king Philipp and othre mo,
  Whan thei ride in the fieldes tho,
  A Phesant cam before here yhe,
  The which anon as thei hire syhe,
  Fleende let an ey doun falle,
  And it tobrak tofore hem alle:[906]
  And as thei token therof kepe,
  Thei syhe out of the schelle crepe
  A litel Serpent on the ground,
  Which rampeth al aboute round,                                  2230
  And in ayein it wolde have wonne,[907]
  Bot for the brennynge of the Sonne
  It mihte noght, and so it deide.
  And therupon the clerkes seide,
  ‘As the Serpent, whan it was oute,
  Went enviroun the schelle aboute
  And mihte noght torne in ayein,
  So schal it fallen in certein:
  This child the world schal environe,
  And above alle the corone                                       2240
  Him schal befalle, and in yong Age
  He schal desire in his corage,
  Whan al the world is in his hond,
  To torn ayein into the lond[908]
  Wher he was bore, and in his weie
  Homward he schal with puison deie.’
    The king, which al this sih and herde,[909]
  Fro that dai forth, hou so it ferde,
  His jalousie hath al foryete.
  Bot he which hath the child begete,                             2250
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 77=]
  Nectanabus, in privete
  The time of his nativite
  Upon the constellacioun
  Awaiteth, and relacion
  Makth to the queene hou sche schal do,[910]
  And every houre apointeth so,
  That no mynut therof was lore.[911]
  So that in due time is bore
  This child, and forth with therupon
  Ther felle wondres many on                                      2260
  Of terremote universiel:
  The Sonne tok colour of stiel
  And loste his lyht, the wyndes blewe,
  And manye strengthes overthrewe;
  The See his propre kinde changeth,
  And al the world his forme strangeth;
  The thonder with his fyri levene
  So cruel was upon the hevene,
  That every erthli creature
  Tho thoghte his lif in aventure.                                2270
  The tempeste ate laste cesseth,
  The child is kept, his age encresseth,
  And Alisandre his name is hote,
  To whom Calistre and Aristote
  To techen him Philosophie
  Entenden, and Astronomie,
  With othre thinges whiche he couthe
  Also, to teche him in his youthe
  Nectanabus tok upon honde.
    Bot every man mai understonde,                                2280
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 78=]
  Of Sorcerie hou that it wende,
  It wole himselve prove at ende,
  And namely forto beguile
  A lady, which withoute guile
  Supposeth trouthe al that sche hiereth:
  Bot often he that evele stiereth
  His Schip is dreynt therinne amidde;
  And in this cas riht so betidde.
  Nectanabus upon a nyht,
  Whan it was fair and sterre lyht,                               2290
  This yonge lord ladde up on hih
  Above a tour, wher as he sih
  The sterres suche as he acompteth,
  And seith what ech of hem amonteth,
  As thogh he knewe of alle thing;
  Bot yit hath he no knowleching
  What schal unto himself befalle.
  Whan he hath told his wordes alle,
  This yonge lord thanne him opposeth,[912]
  And axeth if that he supposeth                                  2300
  What deth he schal himselve deie.[913]
  He seith, ‘Or fortune is aweie
  And every sterre hath lost his wone,[914]
  Or elles of myn oghne Sone
  I schal be slain, I mai noght fle.’
  Thoghte Alisandre in privete,
  ‘Hierof this olde dotard lieth’:
  And er that other oght aspieth,
  Al sodeinliche his olde bones
  He schof over the wal at ones,                                  2310
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 79=]
  And seith him, ‘Ly doun there apart:
  Wherof nou serveth al thin art?
  Thou knewe alle othre mennes chance
  And of thiself hast ignorance:[915]
  That thou hast seid amonges alle
  Of thi persone, is noght befalle.’
    Nectanabus, which hath his deth,
  Yit while him lasteth lif and breth,
  To Alisandre he spak and seide
  That he with wrong blame on him leide;                          2320
  Fro point to point and al the cas
  He tolde, hou he his Sone was.
  Tho he, which sory was ynowh,
  Out of the dich his fader drouh,
  And tolde his moder hou it ferde
  In conseil; and whan sche it herde
  And kneu the toknes whiche he tolde,
  Sche nyste what sche seie scholde,
  Bot stod abayssht as for the while
  Of his magique and al the guile.                                2330
  Sche thoghte hou that sche was deceived,[916]
  That sche hath of a man conceived,
  And wende a god it hadde be.
  Bot natheles in such degre,
  So as sche mihte hire honour save,
  Sche schop the body was begrave.
    And thus Nectanabus aboghte
  The Sorcerie which he wroghte:
  Thogh he upon the creatures
  Thurgh his carectes and figures                                 2340
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 80=]
  The maistrie and the pouer hadde,
  His creatour to noght him ladde,
  Ayein whos lawe his craft he useth,
  Whan he for lust his god refuseth,
  And tok him to the dieules craft,[917]
  Lo, what profit him is belaft:
  That thing thurgh which he wende have stonde,
  Ferst him exilede out of londe
  Which was his oghne, and from a king
  Made him to ben an underling;                                   2350
  And siththen to deceive a queene,
  That torneth him to mochel teene;
  Thurgh lust of love he gat him hate,
  That ende couthe he noght abate.
  His olde sleyhtes whiche he caste,[918]
  Yonge Alisaundre hem overcaste,
  His fader, which him misbegat,[919]
  He slouh, a gret mishap was that;
  Bot for o mis an other mys
  Was yolde, and so fulofte it is;                                2360
  Nectanabus his craft miswente,
  So it misfell him er he wente.
  I not what helpeth that clergie
  Which makth a man to do folie,
  And nameliche of nigromance,
  Which stant upon the mescreance.

  For of his oghne controvinge

  For of Surrie a worthi king

  Bot yit thurgh him this craft is used,
  And he thurgh al the world accused,

  Wherof min herte sore longeth

  Mi Sone, as thou hast preid above
  That I the Scole schal declare
  Of Aristotle and ek the fare
  Of Alisandre, hou he was tauht,
  I am somdel therof destrauht;
  For it is noght to the matiere
  Of love, why we sitten hiere
  To schryve, so as Venus bad.
  Bot natheles, for it is glad,                                     10
  So as thou seist, for thin aprise
  To hiere of suche thinges wise,
  Wherof thou myht the time lisse,[927]
  So as I can, I schal the wisse:
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 85=]
  For wisdom is at every throwe[928]
  Above alle other thing to knowe
  In loves cause and elleswhere.
  Forthi, my Sone, unto thin Ere,
  Though it be noght in the registre
  Of Venus, yit of that Calistre                                    20
  And Aristotle whylom write
  To Alisandre, thou schalt wite.
    Bot for the lores ben diverse,
                              [Sidenote: [THREE PARTS OF PHILOSOPHY.]]
  I thenke ferst to the reherce
  The nature of Philosophie;[929]
  Which Aristotle of his clergie,
  Wys and expert in the sciences,
  Declareth thilke intelligences,[930]
  As of thre pointz in principal.[931]
    Wherof the ferste in special                                    30
  Is Theorique, which is grounded
  On him which al the world hath founded,
  Which comprehendeth al the lore.
    And forto loken overmore,
  Next of sciences the seconde
  Is Rethorique, whos faconde
  Above alle othre is eloquent:
  To telle a tale in juggement
  So wel can noman speke as he.
    The laste science of the thre                                   40
  It is Practique, whos office
  The vertu tryeth fro the vice,
  And techeth upon goode thewes
  To fle the compaignie of schrewes,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 86=]
  Which stant in disposicion
  Of mannes free eleccion.
  Practique enformeth ek the reule,
  Hou that a worthi king schal reule
  His Realme bothe in werre and pes.
    Lo, thus danz Aristotiles                                       50
  These thre sciences hath divided
  And the nature also decided,
  Wherof that ech of hem schal serve.
    The ferste, which is the conserve
  And kepere of the remnant,
  As that which is most sufficant[932]
  And chief of the Philosophie,
  If I therof schal specefie
  So as the Philosophre tolde,
  Nou herkne, and kep that thou it holde.                           60

                                             [Sidenote: [i. THEORIC.]]

      _Plura viros quandoque iuuat nescire, set illud_
        _Quod videt expediens, sobrius ille sapit._

    Of Theorique principal
  The Philosophre in special
  The propretees hath determined,
      [Sidenote: Hic tractat de prima parte Philosophie, que
      Theorica dicitur, cuius natura triplici dotata est
      sciencia, scilicet Theologia, Phisica et Mathematica: set
      primo illam partem Theologie declarabit.]
  As thilke which is enlumined
  Of wisdom and of hih prudence
  Above alle othre in his science:
  And stant departed upon thre,
  The ferste of which in his degre
  Is cleped in Philosophie
  The science of Theologie,                                         70
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 87=]
  That other named is Phisique,
  The thridde is seid Mathematique.
                                               [Sidenote: [THEOLOGY.]]
    Theologie is that science
  Which unto man yifth evidence
  Of thing which is noght bodely,
  Wherof men knowe redely
  The hihe almyhti Trinite,
  Which is o god in unite
  Withouten ende and beginnynge
  And creatour of alle thinge,                                      80
  Of hevene, of erthe and ek of helle.
  Wherof, as olde bokes telle,
  The Philosophre in his resoun
  Wrot upon this conclusioun,
  And of his wrytinge in a clause
  He clepeth god the ferste cause,
  Which of himself is thilke good,[934]
  Withoute whom nothing is good,
  Of which that every creature[935]
  Hath his beinge and his nature.                                   90
      [Sidenote: Nota quod triplex dicitur essencia: Prima
      temporanea, que incipit et desinit, Secunda perpetua, que
      incipit et non desinit, Tercia sempiterna, que nec incipit
      nec desinit.]
  After the beinge of the thinges
  Ther ben thre formes of beinges:[936]
  Thing which began and ende schal,
  That thing is cleped temporal;
  Ther is also be other weie
  Thing which began and schal noght deie,
  As Soules, that ben spiritiel,
  Here beinge is perpetuel:
  Bot ther is on above the Sonne,
  Whos time nevere was begonne,                                    100
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii. 88=]
  And endeles schal evere be;
  That is the god, whos mageste
  Alle othre thinges schal governe,
  And his beinge is sempiterne.
  The god, to whom that al honour
  Belongeth, he is creatour,
  And othre ben hise creatures:
  The god commandeth the natures[937]
  That thei to him obeien alle;[938]
  Withouten him, what so befalle,                                  110
  Her myht is non, and he mai al:
  The god was evere and evere schal,
  And thei begonne of his assent;
  The times alle be present
  To god, to hem and alle unknowe,
  Bot what him liketh that thei knowe:
  Thus bothe an angel and a man,
  The whiche of al that god began
  Be chief, obeien goddes myht,[939]
  And he stant endeles upriht.                                     120
  To this science ben prive
  The clerkes of divinite,
  The whiche unto the poeple prechen
  The feith of holi cherche and techen,
  Which in som cas upon believe
  Stant more than thei conne prieve
  Be weie of Argument sensible:
  Bot natheles it is credible,
  And doth a man gret meede have,
  To him that thenkth himself to save.                             130
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 89=]
  Theologie in such a wise
  Of hih science and hih aprise
  Above alle othre stant unlike,
  And is the ferste of Theorique.

  To techen sondri knowlechinges
  Upon the bodiliche thinges.
  Of man, of beste, of herbe, of ston,
  Of fissch, of foughl, of everychon                               140

                                            [Sidenote: [MATHEMATICS.]]
  The thridde point of Theorique,
      [Sidenote: Nota de tercia parte Theorice, que Mathematica

      intelligencias, scilicet Arsmeticam, Musicam, Geometriam

  Which cleped is Mathematique,
  Devided is in sondri wise
  And stant upon diverse aprise.
  The ferste of whiche is Arsmetique,
  And the secounde is seid Musique,                                150
  The thridde is ek Geometrie,

  After the Scole of Aristote,                                     220
  Of whiche if more I schal reherce,
  Foure elementz ther ben diverse.
    The ferste of hem men erthe calle,
                 [Sidenote: Nota de Terra, quod est primum elementum.]
  Which is the lowest of hem alle,
  And in his forme is schape round,
  Substancial, strong, sadd and sound,
  As that which mad is sufficant
  To bere up al the remenant.
  For as the point in a compas
  Stant evene amiddes, riht so was                                 230
  This erthe set and schal abyde,

    Above therthe kepth his bounde

  And yit he hath noght al fulwonne[996]

  The Mones cercle so lowe is,                                     740
  Wherof the Sonne out of his stage
  Ne seth him noght with full visage,
  For he is with the ground beschaded,
  So that the Mone is somdiel faded
  And may noght fully schyne cler.
  Bot what man under his pouer

  And seche manye londes strange:
  And as of this condicion
  The Mones disposicion                                            750

    Of the Planetes the secounde

  That under him who that bore is,
  In boke he schal be studious
  And in wrytinge curious,                                         760
  And slouh and lustles to travaile

  He loveth ese, he loveth reste,
  So is he noght the worthieste;
  Bot yit with somdiel besinesse

  And as in this condicion,
  Theffect and disposicion
  Of this Planete and of his chance[997]
  Is most in Burgoigne and in France.                              770

  Venus, whos constellacion
  Governeth al the nacion

  To some wel, to some wo.                                         780
  And natheles of this Planete
  The moste part is softe and swete;
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 111=]
  For who that therof takth his berthe,
  He schal desire joie and merthe,
  Gentil, courteis and debonaire,
  To speke his wordes softe and faire,
  Such schal he be be weie of kinde,
  And overal wher he may finde
  Plesance of love, his herte boweth
  With al his myht and there he woweth.                            790
  He is so ferforth Amourous,
  He not what thing is vicious
  Touchende love, for that lawe
  Ther mai no maner man withdrawe,
  The which venerien is bore
  Be weie of kinde, and therefore
  Venus of love the goddesse
  Is cleped: bot of wantounesse[998]
  The climat of hir lecherie
  Is most commun in Lombardie.                                     800
      [Sidenote: Nota de Sole, qui medio planetarum residens

    Next unto this Planete of love
  The brighte Sonne stant above,
  Which is the hindrere of the nyht
  And forthrere of the daies lyht,
  As he which is the worldes ÿe,
  Thurgh whom the lusti compaignie
  Of foules be the morwe singe,
  The freisshe floures sprede and springe,
  The hihe tre the ground beschadeth,
  And every mannes herte gladeth.                                  810
  And for it is the hed Planete,
  Hou that he sitteth in his sete,

  Of what richesse, of what nobleie,
  These bokes telle, and thus thei seie.
      [Sidenote: Nota de curru Solis necnon et de vario eiusdem
      apparatu.]
    Of gold glistrende Spoke and whiel
  The Sonne his carte hath faire and wiel,
  In which he sitt, and is coroned
  With brighte stones environed;
  Of whiche if that I speke schal,
  Ther be tofore in special                                        820
  Set in the front of his corone
  Thre Stones, whiche no persone
  Hath upon Erthe, and the ferste is
  Be name cleped Licuchis;
  That othre tuo be cleped thus,
  Astrices and Ceramius.
  In his corone also behinde,
  Be olde bokes as I finde,
  Ther ben of worthi Stones thre
  Set ech of hem in his degre:                                     830
  Wherof a Cristall is that on,
  Which that corone is set upon;
  The seconde is an Adamant;
  The thridde is noble and avenant,
  Which cleped is Ydriades.
  And over this yit natheles
  Upon the sydes of the werk,
  After the wrytinge of the clerk,
  Ther sitten fyve Stones mo:
  The smaragdine is on of tho,                                     840
  Jaspis and Elitropius
  And Dendides and Jacinctus,
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 113=]
  Lo, thus the corone is beset,
  Wherof it schyneth wel the bet;
  And in such wise his liht to sprede
  Sit with his Diademe on hede
  The Sonne schynende in his carte.
  And forto lede him swithe and smarte
  After the bryhte daies lawe,
  Ther ben ordeined forto drawe                                    850
  Foure hors his Char and him withal,
  Wherof the names telle I schal:
  Eritheüs the ferste is hote,
  The which is red and schyneth hote,
  The seconde Acteos the bryhte,
  Lampes the thridde coursier hihte,
  And Philogeüs is the ferthe,
  That bringen lyht unto this erthe,
  And gon so swift upon the hevene,
  In foure and twenty houres evene                                 860
  The carte with the bryhte Sonne
  Thei drawe, so that overronne
  Thei have under the cercles hihe
  Al Middelerthe in such an hye.
  And thus the Sonne is overal
  The chief Planete imperial,
  Above him and benethe him thre:
  And thus betwen hem regneth he,
  As he that hath the middel place
  Among the Sevene, and of his face                                870
  Be glade alle erthly creatures,
  And taken after the natures

  And in his constellacion
  Who that is bore in special,
  Of good will and of liberal

  And also stonde in mochel grace
  Toward the lordes forto serve
  And gret profit and thonk deserve.                               880
  And over that it causeth yit
  A man to be soubtil of wit
  To worche in gold, and to be wys
  In every thing which is of pris.
  Bot forto speken in what cost
  Of al this erthe he regneth most
  As for wisdom, it is in Grece,
  Wher is apropred thilke spiece.

  Stant Jupiter the delicat,
  Which causeth pes and no debar.                                  910
  For he is cleped that Planete[999]
  Which of his kinde softe and swete
  Attempreth al that to him longeth;
  And whom this planete underfongeth
  To stonde upon his regiment,

  Bot yit the bokes tellen this,
  That word above alle erthli thinges
  Is vertuous in his doinges,
  Wher so it be to evele or goode.
  For if the wordes semen goode                                   1550

  Whan that ther is no trouthe there,

  The whos science stant proclamed
  To teche of vertu thilke reule,
  Hou that a king himself schal reule

  Of good livinge in his persone,
  Which is the chief of his corone.
  It makth a king also to lerne
  Hou he his bodi schal governe,                                  1660
  Hou he schal wake, hou he schal slepe,
  Hou that he schal his hele kepe
  In mete, in drinke, in clothinge eke:
  Ther is no wisdom forto seke
  As for the reule of his persone,
  The which that this science al one[1062]
  Ne techeth as be weie of kinde,
  That ther is nothing left behinde.
    That other point which to Practique
  Belongeth is Iconomique,[1063]                                  1670
  Which techeth thilke honestete[1064]
  Thurgh which a king in his degre
  His wif and child schal reule and guie,
  So forth with al the companie
  Which in his houshold schal abyde,
  And his astat on every syde

  Thurgh hih pourveied ordinance[1065]
  A king schal sette in governance

  The poeple; for of his kinghede
  He mai hem bothe save and spille.
  And for it stant upon his wille,
  It sit him wel to ben avised,
  And the vertus whiche are assissed[1072]
  Unto a kinges Regiment,
  To take in his entendement:                                     1720
  Wherof to tellen, as thei stonde,
  Hierafterward nou woll I fonde.
    Among the vertus on is chief,
  And that is trouthe, which is lief
  To god and ek to man also.
  And for it hath ben evere so,
  Tawhte Aristotle, as he wel couthe,
  To Alisandre, hou in his youthe
  He scholde of trouthe thilke grace
  With al his hole herte embrace,                                 1730
  So that his word be trewe and plein,
  Toward the world and so certein
  That in him be no double speche:
  For if men scholde trouthe seche
  And founde it noght withinne a king,
  It were an unsittende thing.
  The word is tokne of that withinne,
  Ther schal a worthi king beginne
  To kepe his tunge and to be trewe,
  So schal his pris ben evere newe.                               1740
  Avise him every man tofore,
  And be wel war, er he be swore,
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 144=]
  For afterward it is to late,
  If that he wole his word debate.[1073]
  For as a king in special
  Above all othre is principal
  Of his pouer, so scholde he be
  Most vertuous in his degre;
  And that mai wel be signefied[1074]
  Be his corone and specified.                                    1750
          [Sidenote: Nota super hiis que in corona Regis designantur.[1075]]
    The gold betokneth excellence,
  That men schull don him reverence
  As to here liege soverein.
  The Stones, as the bokes sein,
  Commended ben in treble wise:
  Ferst thei ben harde, and thilke assisse
  Betokneth in a king Constance,
  So that ther schal no variance
  Be founde in his condicion;
  And also be descripcion                                         1760
  The vertu which is in the stones
  A verrai Signe is for the nones
  Of that a king schal ben honeste
  And holde trewly his beheste
  Of thing which longeth to kinghede:
  The bryhte colour, as I rede,
  Which in the stones is schynende,
  Is in figure betoknende

  Which stant upon his goode name.[1077]                          1770

  Which stant under his Gerarchie,
  That he it schal wel kepe and guye.
    And for that trouthe, hou so it falle,
  Is the vertu soverein of alle,
  That longeth unto regiment,
  A tale, which is evident
  Of trouthe in comendacioun,
  Toward thin enformacion,                                        1780

                            [Sidenote: [KING, WINE, WOMAN AND TRUTH.]]
    As the Cronique it doth reherce,
  A Soldan whilom was of Perce,
      [Sidenote: Hic narrat, qualiter Darius filius Ytaspis
      Soldanus Percie a tribus suis Cubiculariis, quorum nomina
      Arpaghes, Manachaz et Zorobabel dicta sunt, nomine

      aut vinum maioris fortitudinis vim obtineret: ipsis vero
      varia opinione respondentibus, Zorobabel vltimus asseruit[1082]
      quod mulier sui amoris complacencia tam Regis quam vini
      potenciam excellit. Addidit insuper pro finali conclusione
      dicens, quod veritas super omnia vincit. Cuius responsio
      ceteris laudabilior acceptabatur.]
  Which Daires hihte, and Ytaspis
  His fader was; and soth it is
  That thurgh wisdom and hih prudence
  Mor than for eny reverence
  Of his lignage as be descente[1078]
  The regne of thilke empire he hente:                            1790
  And as he was himselve wys,[1079]
  The wisemen he hield in pris[1080]
  And soghte hem oute on every side,[1081]
  That toward him thei scholde abide.
  Among the whiche thre ther were
  That most service unto him bere
  As thei which in his chambre lyhen[1083]
  And al his conseil herde and syhen.
  Here names ben of strange note,
  Arpaghes was the ferste hote,[1084]                             1800
  And Manachaz was the secounde,
  Zorobabel, as it is founde
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 146=]
  In the Cronique, was the thridde.
  This Soldan, what so him betidde,
  To hem he triste most of alle,[1085]
  Wherof the cas is so befalle:
  This lord, which hath conceiptes depe,
  Upon a nyht whan he hath slepe,
  As he which hath his wit desposed,
  Touchende a point hem hath opposed.                             1810
    The kinges question was this;
  Of thinges thre which strengest is,
  The wyn, the womman or the king:
  And that thei scholde upon this thing
  Of here ansuere avised be,[1086]
  He yaf hem fulli daies thre,
  And hath behote hem be his feith
  That who the beste reson seith,
  He schal resceive a worthi mede.
    Upon this thing thei token hiede                              1820
  And stoden in desputeison,
  That be diverse opinion
  Of Argumentz that thei have holde
  Arpaghes ferst his tale tolde,
  And seide hou that the strengthe of kinges
  Is myhtiest of alle thinges.
  For king hath pouer over man,
  And man is he which reson can,
  As he which is of his nature
  The moste noble creature                                        1830
  Of alle tho that god hath wroght:
  And be that skile it semeth noght,
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 147=]
  He seith, that eny erthly thing
  Mai be so myhty as a king.
  A king mai spille, a king mai save,
  A king mai make of lord a knave[1087]
  And of a knave a lord also:
  The pouer of a king stant so,
  That he the lawes overpasseth;
  What he wol make lasse, he lasseth,                             1840
  What he wol make more, he moreth;
  And as the gentil faucon soreth,[1088]
  He fleth, that noman him reclameth;
  Bot he al one alle othre tameth,
  And stant himself of lawe fre.
  Lo, thus a kinges myht, seith he,
  So as his reson can argue,
  Is strengest and of most value.
    Bot Manachaz seide otherwise,
  That wyn is of the more emprise;                                1850
  And that he scheweth be this weie.
  The wyn fulofte takth aweie
  The reson fro the mannes herte;
  The wyn can make a krepel sterte,
  And a delivere man unwelde;
  It makth a blind man to behelde,
  And a bryht yhed seme derk;
  It makth a lewed man a clerk,
  And fro the clerkes the clergie
  It takth aweie, and couardie                                    1860
  It torneth into hardiesse;
  Of Avarice it makth largesse.
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 148=]
  The wyn makth ek the goode blod,
  In which the Soule which is good
  Hath chosen hire a resting place,
  Whil that the lif hir wole embrace.
  And be this skile Manachas
  Ansuered hath upon this cas,
  And seith that wyn be weie of kinde
  Is thing which mai the hertes binde                             1870
  Wel more than the regalie.
    Zorobabel for his partie
  Seide, as him thoghte for the beste,
  That wommen ben the myhtieste.
  The king and the vinour also
  Of wommen comen bothe tuo;
  And ek he seide hou that manhede
  Thurgh strengthe unto the wommanhede
  Of love, wher he wole or non,
  Obeie schal; and therupon,                                      1880
  To schewe of wommen the maistrie,
  A tale which he syh with yhe[1089]
  As for ensample he tolde this,--[1090]
      [Sidenote: Nota hic de vigore amoris, qui inter Cirum Regem
      Persarum et Apemen Besazis filiam ipsius Regis Concubinam
      spectante tota Curia experiebatur.]
    Hou Apemen, of Besazis[1091]
  Which dowhter was, in the paleis
  Sittende upon his hihe deis,
  Whan he was hotest in his ire
  Toward the grete of his empire,
  Cirus the king tirant sche tok,
  And only with hire goodly lok                                   1890
  Sche made him debonaire and meke,
  And be the chyn and be the cheke
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 149=]
  Sche luggeth him riht as hir liste,
  That nou sche japeth, nou sche kiste,
  And doth with him what evere hir liketh;
  Whan that sche loureth, thanne he siketh,
  And whan sche gladeth, he is glad:
  And thus this king was overlad
  With hire which his lemman was.
  Among the men is no solas,                                      1900
  If that ther be no womman there;
  For bot if that the wommen were,[1092]
  This worldes joie were aweie:
  Thurgh hem men finden out the weie
  To knihthode and to worldes fame;
  Thei make a man to drede schame,
  And honour forto be desired:
  Thurgh the beaute of hem is fyred
  The Dart of which Cupide throweth,
  Wherof the jolif peine groweth,                                 1910
  Which al the world hath under fote.
  A womman is the mannes bote,
  His lif, his deth, his wo, his wel;
  And this thing mai be schewed wel,
  Hou that wommen ben goode and kihde,
  For in ensample this I finde.
                                       [Sidenote: [TALE OF ALCESTIS.]]
    Whan that the duk Ametus lay

  Sek in his bedd, that every day
  Men waiten whan he scholde deie,
  Alceste his wif goth forto preie,                               1920
  As sche which wolde thonk deserve,
  With Sacrifice unto Minerve,
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 150=]
  To wite ansuere of the goddesse

  Wherof he was so wo besein,

  Lo, thus sche cride and thus sche preide,

  That if sche wolde for his sake
  The maladie soffre and take,                                    1930
  And deie hirself, he scholde live.
  Of this ansuere Alceste hath yive[1093]
  Unto Minerve gret thonkinge,
  So that hir deth and his livinge
  Sche ches with al hire hole entente,
  And thus acorded hom sche wente.
  Into the chambre and whan sche cam,
  Hire housebonde anon sche nam
  In bothe hire Armes and him kiste,
  And spak unto him what hire liste;                              1940
  And therupon withinne a throwe
  This goode wif was overthrowe[1094]
  And deide, and he was hool in haste.
  So mai a man be reson taste,
  Hou next after the god above
  The trouthe of wommen and the love,
  In whom that alle grace is founde,
  Is myhtiest upon this grounde
  And most behovely manyfold.
    Lo, thus Zorobabel hath told                                  1950
  The tale of his opinion:
  Bot for final conclusion
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 151=]
  What strengest is of erthli thinges,
  The wyn, the wommen or the kinges,
  He seith that trouthe above hem alle
  Is myhtiest, hou evere it falle.
  The trouthe, hou so it evere come,
  Mai for nothing ben overcome;
  It mai wel soffre for a throwe,
  Bot ate laste it schal be knowe.                                1960
  The proverbe is, who that is trewe,
  Him schal his while nevere rewe:
  For hou so that the cause wende,
  The trouthe is schameles ate ende,
  Bot what thing that is troutheles,
  It mai noght wel be schameles,
  And schame hindreth every wyht:
  So proveth it, ther is no myht
  Withoute trouthe in no degre.
  And thus for trouthe of his decre                               1970
  Zorobabel was most commended,
  Wherof the question was ended,
  And he resceived hath his mede
  For trouthe, which to mannes nede
  Is most behoveliche overal.
  Forthi was trouthe in special
  The ferste point in observance
  Betake unto the governance[1095]
  Of Alisandre, as it is seid:
  For therupon the ground is leid[1096]                           1980
  Of every kinges regiment,
  As thing which most convenient
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 152=]
  Is forto sette a king in evene
  Bothe in this world and ek in hevene.

  The king upon his Regalie,
  As he which hath to justifie
  The worldes good fro covoitise.
  So sit it wel in alle wise
  A king betwen the more and lesse[1099]
  To sette his herte upon largesse
  Toward himself and ek also
  Toward his poeple; and if noght so,
  That is to sein, if that he be

                     [Sidenote: [TALE OF JULIUS AND THE POOR KNIGHT.]]
    In Rome, to poursuie his riht,
  Ther was a worthi povere kniht,
      [Sidenote: Hic secundum gesta Iulii exemplum ponit,
      qualiter Rex suorum militum, quos probos agnouerit,

      tenetur.]
  Which cam al one forto sein
  His cause, when the court was plein,
  Wher Julius was in presence.
  And for him lacketh of despence,
  Ther was with him non advocat
  To make ple for his astat.
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 155=]
  Bot thogh him lacke forto plede,
  Him lacketh nothing of manhede;                                 2070
  He wiste wel his pours was povere,
  Bot yit he thoghte his riht recovere,
  And openly poverte alleide,
  To themperour and thus he seide:
  ‘O Julius, lord of the lawe,
  Behold, mi conseil is withdrawe
  For lacke of gold: do thin office[1103]
  After the lawes of justice:[1104]
  Help that I hadde conseil hiere
  Upon the trouthe of mi matiere.’                                2080
  And Julius with that anon
  Assigned him a worthi on,
  Bot he himself no word ne spak.
  This kniht was wroth and fond a lak
  In themperour, and seide thus:
  ‘O thou unkinde Julius,
  Whan thou in thi bataille were
  Up in Aufrique, and I was there,
  Mi myht for thi rescousse I dede
  And putte noman in my stede,                                    2090
  Thou wost what woundes ther I hadde:
  Bot hier I finde thee so badde,
  That thee ne liste speke o word[1105]
  Thin oghne mouth, nor of thin hord
  To yive a florin me to helpe.
  Hou scholde I thanne me beyelpe
  Fro this dai forth of thi largesse,
  Whan such a gret unkindenesse
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 156=]
  Is founde in such a lord as thou?’
    This Julius knew wel ynou                                     2100
  That al was soth which he him tolde;
  And for he wolde noght ben holde

  And as it were of goddes sonde,
  He yaf him good ynouh to spende
  For evere into his lives ende.[1106]
  And thus scholde every worthi king
  Take of his knihtes knowleching,

      [Sidenote: Hic ponit exemplum de Rege Antigono, qualiter

  So that he mai his yifte wite:
  Wherof I finde a tale write,

  The king ansuerde to him thus,[1107]
  And seide hou such a yifte passeth
  His povere astat: and thanne he lasseth,
  And axeth bot a litel peny,
  If that the king wol yive him eny.
  The king ansuerde, it was to smal
  For him, which was a lord real;[1108]

    Be this ensample a king mai lere
                                   [Sidenote: [DISCRETION IN GIVING.]]
  That forto yive is in manere:
  For if a king his tresor lasseth
  Withoute honour and thonkles passeth,
  Whan he himself wol so beguile,
  I not who schal compleigne his while,
  Ne who be rihte him schal relieve.
  Bot natheles this I believe,
  To helpe with his oghne lond
  Behoveth every man his hond[1109]                               2140

  At Rome, I thenke forto tellen.
  For whan the chances so befellen
  That eny Emperour as tho[1131]
  Victoire hadde upon his fo,
  And so forth cam to Rome ayein,
  Of treble honour he was certein,
  Wherof that he was magnefied.
  The ferste, as it is specefied,
  Was, whan he cam at thilke tyde,
  The Charr in which he scholde ryde                              2370
  Foure whyte Stiedes scholden drawe;

  And for non other flaterie.                                     2380

  Wher he sat in his Charr real,
  Beside him was a Ribald set,
  Which hadde hise wordes so beset,[1136]

  This Ribald, which sat with him tho,
  To Themperour his tale tolde:

  And so myhte every man aboute

  And al was this the cause why;
  That whil he stod in that noblesse,[1137]

  Wher that he sat in his persone                                 2450
  And was hyest in al his pris,
  A man, which wolde make him wys,
  Fell doun knelende in his presence,
  And dede him such a reverence,
  As thogh the hihe god it were:
  Men hadden gret mervaille there

  And forth with al the same tyde

  Hou that he wolde gladly hiere

  That he his conseil myhte yive
  To what point that it schal be drive.[1154]
    And in that time so befell,
  Ther was such on in Irahel,
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 172=]
  Which sette him al to flaterie,
  And he was cleped Sedechie;
  And after him Achab hath sent:
  And he at his comandement
  Tofore him cam, and be a sleyhte
  He hath upon his heved on heyhte                                2570
  Tuo large hornes set of bras,
  As he which al a flatour was,
  And goth rampende as a leoun
  And caste hise hornes up and doun,
  And bad men ben of good espeir,
  For as the homes percen their,
  He seith, withoute resistence,
  So wiste he wel of his science
  That Benedab is desconfit.
  Whan Sedechie upon this plit                                    2580
  Hath told this tale to his lord,
  Anon ther were of his acord
  Prophetes false manye mo
  To bere up oil, and alle tho
  Affermen that which he hath told,
  Wherof the king Achab was bold
  And yaf hem yiftes al aboute.
  But Josaphat was in gret doute,                              (2600*)
  And hield fantosme al that he herde,
  Preiende Achab, hou so it ferde,                                2590
  If ther were eny other man,
  The which of prophecie can,
  To hiere him speke er that thei gon.
  Quod Achab thanne, ‘Ther is on,[1155]
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 173=]
  A brothell, which Micheas hihte;
  Bot he ne comth noght in my sihte,
  For he hath longe in prison lein.
  Him liketh nevere yit to sein[1156]
  A goodly word to mi plesance;
  And natheles at thin instance                                   2600
  He schal come oute, and thanne he may
  Seie as he seide many day;
  For yit he seide nevere wel.’
  Tho Josaphat began somdel
  To gladen him in hope of trouthe,
  And bad withouten eny slouthe
  That men him scholden fette anon.
  And thei that weren for him gon,
  Whan that thei comen wher he was,[1157]
  Thei tolden unto Micheas                                        2610
  The manere hou that Sedechie
  Declared hath his prophecie;
  And therupon thei preie him faire
  That he wol seie no contraire,
  Wherof the king mai be desplesed,
  For so schal every man ben esed,
  And he mai helpe himselve also.
    Micheas upon trouthe tho
  His herte sette, and to hem seith,[1158]
  Al that belongeth to his feith                                  2620
  And of non other feigned thing,
  That wol he telle unto his king,[1159]
  Als fer as god hath yove him grace.
  Thus cam this prophete into place
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 174=]
  Wher he the kinges wille herde;
  And he therto anon ansuerde,
  And seide unto him in this wise:
  ‘Mi liege lord, for mi servise,
  Which trewe hath stonden evere yit,
  Thou hast me with prisone aquit:                                2630
  Bot for al that I schal noght glose
  Of trouthe als fer as I suppose;
  And as touchende of this bataille,[1160]
  Thou schalt noght of the sothe faile.
  For if it like thee to hiere,
  As I am tauht in that matiere,
  Thou miht it understonde sone;[1161]
  Bot what is afterward to done
  Avise thee, for this I sih.
  I was tofor the throne on hih,                                  2640
  Wher al the world me thoghte stod,[1162]
  And there I herde and understod
  The vois of god with wordes cliere
  Axende, and seide in this manere:
  “In what thing mai I best beguile
  The king Achab?” And for a while
  Upon this point thei spieken faste.
  Tho seide a spirit ate laste,
  “I undertake this emprise.”
  And god him axeth in what wise.                                 2650
  “I schal,” quod he, “deceive and lye
  With flaterende prophecie
  In suche mouthes as he lieveth.”
  And he which alle thing achieveth
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 175=]
  Bad him go forth and don riht so.
  And over this I sih also
  The noble peple of Irahel[1163]
  Dispers as Schep upon an hell,
  Withoute a kepere unarraied:
  And as thei wente aboute astraied,                              2660
  I herde a vois unto hem sein,
  “Goth hom into your hous ayein,
  Til I for you have betre ordeigned.”’
    Quod Sedechie, ‘Thou hast feigned
  This tale in angringe of the king.’
  And in a wraththe upon this thing
  He smot Michee upon the cheke;
  The king him hath rebuked eke,
  And every man upon him cride:
  Thus was he schent on every side,                               2670
  Ayein and into prison lad,
  For so the king himselve bad.
  The trouthe myhte noght ben herd;
  Bot afterward as it hath ferd,
  The dede proveth his entente:
  Achab to the bataille wente,
  Wher Benedab for al his Scheld
  Him slouh, so that upon the feld
  His poeple goth aboute astray.
  Bot god, which alle thinges may,                                2680
  So doth that thei no meschief have;
  Here king was ded and thei ben save,
  And hom ayein in goddes pes

    So sit it wel a king therfore
  To loven hem that trouthe mene;
  For ate laste it wol be sene                                 (2700*)

  As forto speken overmore[1165]
  After the Philosophres lore,
  The thridde point of Policie

    What is a lond wher men ben none?
  What ben the men whiche are al one

  Withoute a kinges governance?
  What is a king in his ligance,
  Wher that ther is no lawe in londe?
  What is to take lawe on honde,                                  2700
  Bot if the jugges weren trewe?
  These olde worldes with the newe
  Who that wol take in evidence,
  Ther mai he se thexperience,
  What thing it is to kepe lawe,
  Thurgh which the wronges ben withdrawe
  And rihtwisnesse stant commended,
  Wherof the regnes ben amended.
  For wher the lawe mai comune
  The lordes forth with the commune,[1167]                        2710
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 177=]
  Ech hath his propre duete;
  And ek the kinges realte
  Of bothe his worschipe underfongeth,
  To his astat as it belongeth,
  Which of his hihe worthinesse
  Hath to governe rihtwisnesse,
  As he which schal the lawe guide.
  And natheles upon som side
  His pouer stant above the lawe,
  To yive bothe and to withdrawe                                  2720
  The forfet of a mannes lif;
  But thinges whiche are excessif
  Ayein the lawe, he schal noght do
  For love ne for hate also.
    The myhtes of a king ben grete,
  Bot yit a worthi king schal lete
      [Sidenote: Imperatoriam maiestatem non solum armis, set
      eciam legibus oportet esse armatam.]
  Of wrong to don, al that he myhte;
  For he which schal the poeple ryhte,
  It sit wel to his regalie
  That he himself ferst justefie                                  2730
  Towardes god in his degre:
  For his astat is elles fre
  Toward alle othre in his persone,
  Save only to the god al one,
  Which wol himself a king chastise,
  Wher that non other mai suffise.
  So were it good to taken hiede
  That ferst a king his oghne dede
  Betwen the vertu and the vice
  Redresce, and thanne of his justice                             2740
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 178=]
  So sette in evene the balance
  Towardes othre in governance,
  That to the povere and to the riche
  Hise lawes myhten stonde liche,
  He schal excepte no persone.
  Bot for he mai noght al him one
  In sondri places do justice,[1168]
  He schal of his real office
  With wys consideracion
  Ordeigne his deputacion[1169]                                   2750
  Of suche jugges as ben lerned,
  So that his poeple be governed
  Be hem that trewe ben and wise.
  For if the lawe of covoitise
  Be set upon a jugges hond,
  Wo is the poeple of thilke lond,
  For wrong mai noght himselven hyde:
  Bot elles on that other side,
  If lawe stonde with the riht,
  The poeple is glad and stant upriht.                            2760
  Wher as the lawe is resonable,
  The comun poeple stant menable,[1170]
  And if the lawe torne amis,
  The poeple also mistorned is.

  And let it openly proclame
  What man he were, or evel or good.
  And upon that his name stod
  Enclin to vertu or to vice,[1171]
  So wolde he sette him in office,
  Or elles putte him al aweie.
  Thus hield the lawe his rihte weie,

    In a Cronique I finde thus,
  Hou that Gayus Fabricius,
  Which whilom was Consul of Rome,
      [Sidenote: Hic ponit exemplum de iudicibus incorruptis. Et
      narrat qualiter Gayus Fabricius nuper Rome Consul aurum

  Be whom the lawes yede and come,
  Whan the Sampnites to him broghte
  A somme of gold, and him besoghte                            (2800*)
  To don hem favour in the lawe,
  Toward the gold he gan him drawe,                               2790
  Wherof in alle mennes lok
  A part up in his hond he tok,[1172]
  Which to his mouth in alle haste
  He putte, it forto smelle and taste,[1173]
  And to his yhe and to his Ere,
  Bot he ne fond no confort there:
  And thanne he gan it to despise,
  And tolde unto hem in this wise:
  ‘I not what is with gold to thryve,
  Whan non of all my wittes fyve                                  2800

  Fynt savour ne delit therinne.
  So is it bot a nyce Sinne
  Of gold to ben to covoitous;
  Bot he is riche and glorious,
  Which hath in his subjeccion
  Tho men whiche in possession[1174]
  Ben riche of gold, and be this skile;
  For he mai aldai whan he wile,
  Or be hem lieve or be hem lothe,

  Lo, thus he seide, and with that word
  He threw tofore hem on the bord
  The gold out of his hond anon,
  And seide hem that he wolde non:[1175]
  So that he kepte his liberte
  To do justice and equite,
  Withoute lucre of such richesse.
    Ther be nou fewe of suche, I gesse;
  For it was thilke times used,
  That every jugge was refused                                    2820
  Which was noght frend to comun riht;
  Bot thei that wolden stonde upriht

  To deme and jugge commun lawe:

  To sette a lawe and kepe it noght
  Ther is no comun profit soght;

  Was hote, a jugge laweles

  And noght upon the singuler
  Ordeigned was, and the pouer
  Of hem that weren in astat
  Was sauf: wherof upon debat
  Ther stod nothing, so that in reste
  Mihte every man his herte reste.
    And whan this noble rihtful king
  Sih hou it ferde of al this thing,
  Wherof the poeple stod in ese,

  And schop if that it myhte be,

  And therupon his wit he caste
  What thing him were best to feigne,
  That he his pourpos myhte atteigne.

  In audience of grete and smale,[1187]
  And in this wise he tolde his tale:
  ‘God wot, and so ye witen alle,

  And nothing of myn oghne wit;

  And schal do lengere, if ye wile.
  For I wol telle you the skile;

  Of suche lawes as I made,
  Wherof that ye ben alle glade;                                  2970
  It was the god and nothing I,
  Which dede al this, and nou forthi
  He hath comanded of his grace
  That I schal come into a place
  Which is forein out in an yle,
  Wher I mot tarie for a while,
  With him to speke, as he hath bede.[1189]
  For as he seith, in thilke stede

  In his rancour and in his hete

  And whan this king him hadde in honde,
  He wol no mercy understonde,                                 (3650*)
  Bot dede him slen in his presence.
    The tidinge of this violence[1273]
  Whan it cam to the moder Ere,

  To suche frendes as sche hadde,
  A gret pouer til that sche ladde.
  In sondri wise and tho sche caste
  Hou sche this king mai overcaste;                               3460
  And ate laste acorded was,
  That in the danger of a pass,
  Thurgh which this tirant scholde passe,
  Sche schop his pouer to compasse[1274]
  With strengthe of men be such a weie[1275]
  That he schal noght eschape aweie.
  And whan sche hadde thus ordeigned,
  Sche hath hir oghne bodi feigned,
  For feere as thogh sche wolde flee
  Out of hir lond: and whan that he                               3470
  Hath herd hou that this ladi fledde,
  So faste after the chace he spedde,
  That he was founde out of array.
  For it betidde upon a day,
  Into the pas whanne he was falle,
  Thembuisschementz tobrieken alle[1276]
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 209=]
  And him beclipte on every side,
  That fle ne myhte he noght aside:
  So that ther weren dede and take
  Tuo hundred thousend for his sake,                              3480
  That weren with him of his host.
  And thus was leid the grete bost
  Of him and of his tirannie:[1277]
  It halp no mercy forto crie[1278]
  To him which whilom dede non;
  For he unto the queene anon
  Was broght, and whan that sche him sih,
  This word sche spak and seide on hih:
  ‘O man, which out of mannes kinde
  Reson of man hast left behinde                                  3490
  And lived worse than a beste,
  Whom Pite myhte noght areste,
  The mannes blod to schede and spille
  Thou haddest nevere yit thi fille.
  Bot nou the laste time is come,
  That thi malice is overcome:
  As thou til othre men hast do,
  Nou schal be do to thee riht so.’
  Tho bad this ladi that men scholde
  A vessel bringe, in which sche wolde                            3500

  Which sche began anon devise;                                (3700*)
  And tok the Princes whiche he ladde,
  Be whom his chief conseil he hadde,
  And whil hem lasteth eny breth,[1279]
  Sche made hem blede to the deth
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 210=]
  Into the vessel wher it stod:
  And whan it was fulfild of blod,
  Sche caste this tirant therinne,
  And seide him, ‘Lo, thus myht thou wynne[1280]                  3510
  The lustes of thin appetit.
  In blod was whilom thi delit,
  Nou schalt thou drinken al thi fille.’
    And thus onliche of goddes wille,
  He which that wolde himselve strange
  To Pite, fond mercy so strange,
  That he withoute grace is lore.
  So may it schewe wel therfore
  That crualte hath no good ende;
  Bot Pite, hou so that it wende,                                 3520
  Makth that the god is merciable,
  If ther be cause resonable
  Why that a king schal be pitous.[1281]
  Bot elles, if he be doubtous
  To slen in cause of rihtwisnesse,
  It mai be said no Pitousnesse,
  Bot it is Pusillamite,
                         [Sidenote: [MERCY MUST BE WITHOUT WEAKNESS.]]
  Which every Prince scholde flee.
  For if Pite mesure excede,
  Kinghode may noght wel procede[1282]                            3530
  To do justice upon the riht:
  For it belongeth to a knyht
  Als gladly forto fihte as reste,
  To sette his liege poeple in reste,
  Whan that the werre upon hem falleth;

  So that knyhthode is set behinde.
  Of Aristotles lore I finde,
  A king schal make good visage,
  That noman knowe of his corage
  Bot al honour and worthinesse:
  For if a king schal upon gesse

  He mai be lich to that I rede;                                  3550
  And thogh that it be lich a fable,[1283]
  Thensample is good and resonable.                            (3750*)

                             [Sidenote: [THE MOUNTAIN AND THE MOUSE.]]
    As it be olde daies fell,

  Up in the londes of Archade
  A wonder dredful noise made;[1284]
  For so it fell that ilke day,
  This hell on his childinge lay,
  And whan the throwes on him come,
  His noise lich the day of dome                                  3560
  Was ferfull in a mannes thoght
  Of thing which that thei sihe noght,
  Bot wel thei herden al aboute
  The noise, of which thei were in doute,
  As thei that wenden to be lore
  Of thing which thanne was unbore.
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 212=]
  The nerr this hell was upon chance
  To taken his deliverance,
  The more unbuxomliche he cride;
  And every man was fledd aside,                                  3570
  For drede and lefte his oghne hous:
  And ate laste it was a Mous,
  The which was bore and to norrice
  Betake; and tho thei hield hem nyce,[1285]
  For thei withoute cause dradde.[1286]
    Thus if a king his herte ladde
  With every thing that he schal hiere,
  Fulofte he scholde change his chiere
  And upon fantasie drede,
  Whan that ther is no cause of drede.                            3580

  Thus was with him bot only left
  The thridde part, and yit god eft

  To Gedeon: ‘If it so is

  To slen it is a dedly vice,[1313]

  What he wolde axe, as of o thing.
  And he, which was a newe king,
  Forth therupon his bone preide
  To god, and in this wise he seide:                              3900

  Ferst him behoveth forto have
  After the god and his believe
  Such conseil which is to believe,
  Fulfild of trouthe and rihtwisnesse:
  Bot above alle in his noblesse
  Betwen the reddour and pite
  A king schal do such equite                                     3920
  And sette the balance in evene,
  So that the hihe god in hevene

  Withinne himself thurgh providence

  And forto finde ensample of this,

                             [Sidenote: [THE COURTIERS AND THE FOOL.]]
    In a Cronique it telleth thus:
  The king of Rome Lucius
  Withinne his chambre upon a nyht
      [Sidenote: Hic de Lucio Imperatore exemplum ponit, qualiter
      Princeps sui nominis famam a secretis consiliariis
      sapienter inuestigare debet; et si quid in ea sinistrum

  The Steward of his hous, a knyht,
  Forth with his Chamberlein also,
  To conseil hadde bothe tuo,                                     3950
  And stoden be the Chiminee
  Togedre spekende alle thre.                                  (4150*)
  And happeth that the kinges fol
  Sat be the fyr upon a stol,
  As he that with his babil pleide,
  Bot yit he herde al that thei seide,
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 225=]
  And therof token thei non hiede.
  The king hem axeth what to rede
  Of such matiere as cam to mouthe,
  And thei him tolden as thei couthe.                             3960
  Whan al was spoke of that thei mente,
  The king with al his hole entente
  Thanne ate laste hem axeth this,
  What king men tellen that he is:
  Among the folk touchende his name,
  Or be it pris, or be it blame,
  Riht after that thei herden sein,
  He bad hem forto telle it plein,
  That thei no point of soth forbere,
  Be thilke feith that thei him bere.                             3970
    The Steward ferst upon this thing
  Yaf his ansuere unto the king
  And thoghte glose in this matiere,
  And seide, als fer as he can hiere,
  His name is good and honourable:
  Thus was the Stieward favorable,
  That he the trouthe plein ne tolde.
  The king thanne axeth, as he scholde,
  The Chamberlein of his avis.
    And he, that was soubtil and wys,                             3980
  And somdiel thoghte upon his feith,
  Him tolde hou al the poeple seith
  That if his conseil were trewe,
  Thei wiste thanne wel and knewe[1317]
  That of himself he scholde be
  A worthi king in his degre:
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 226=]
  And thus the conseil he accuseth
  In partie, and the king excuseth.
    The fol, which herde of al the cas[1318]
  That time, as goddes wille was,[1319]                           3990
  Sih that thei seiden noght ynowh,
  And hem to skorne bothe lowh,
  And to the king he seide tho:
  ‘Sire king, if that it were so,
  Of wisdom in thin oghne mod
  That thou thiselven were good,
  Thi conseil scholde noght be badde.’
  The king therof merveille hadde,
  Whan that a fol so wisly spak,
  And of himself fond out the lack                                4000
  Withinne his oghne conscience:
  And thus the foles evidence,                                 (4200*)
  Which was of goddes grace enspired,
  Makth that good conseil was desired.[1320]
  He putte awey the vicious
  And tok to him the vertuous;
  The wrongful lawes ben amended,
  The londes good is wel despended,
  The poeple was nomore oppressed,
  And thus stod every thing redressed.                            4010
  For where a king is propre wys,
  And hath suche as himselven is
  Of his conseil, it mai noght faile
  That every thing ne schal availe:
  The vices thanne gon aweie,
  And every vertu holt his weie;
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 227=]
  Wherof the hihe god is plesed,
  And al the londes folk is esed.
  For if the comun poeple crie,
  And thanne a king list noght to plie[1321]                      4020
  To hiere what the clamour wolde,
  And otherwise thanne he scholde
  Desdeigneth forto don hem grace,
  It hath be sen in many place,
  Ther hath befalle gret contraire;
  And that I finde of ensamplaire.

  And al was under the visage

  Bot nou it is befalle so,
  That al is mad, riht as he seide,

  To pilen of the poeple more,
  Which long time hath be grieved sore.
  And in this wise as we thee seie,

  To gon and comen at thin heste.’
    The king, which herde this requeste,
  Seith that he wole ben avised,
  And hath therof a time assised;
  And in the while as he him thoghte
  Upon this thing, conseil he soghte.
  And ferst the wise knyhtes olde,

  For so he mai his regne achieve
  With thing which schal him litel grieve.

    This yonge king him hath conformed
  To don as he was last enformed,

  So thei begunne forto rave,
  That he was fain himself to save;                               4110

  That Pite is the foundement
  Of every kinges regiment,
  If it be medled with justice.
  Thei tuo remuen alle vice,                                      4200
  And ben of vertu most vailable
  To make a kinges regne stable.                               (4400*)
    Lo, thus the foure pointz tofore,
  In governance as thei ben bore,
  Of trouthe ferst and of largesse,
  Of Pite forth with rihtwisnesse,
  I have hem told; and over this
  The fifte point, so as it is[1338]
  Set of the reule of Policie,
  Wherof a king schal modefie                                     4210
  The fleisschly lustes of nature,
  Nou thenk I telle of such mesure,[1339]
  That bothe kinde schal be served
  And ek the lawe of god observed.

                    [Sidenote: [THE FIFTH POINT OF POLICY. CHASTITY.]]

        _Nominis vt famam nulla libido ruat._

        _Sit nisi magnanimi cordis, vt obstet ei._

    The Madle is mad for the femele,
  Bot where as on desireth fele,
  That nedeth noght be weie of kinde:
      [Sidenote: Hic tractat secundum Aristotelem de quinta
      principum regiminis Policia, que Castitatem concernit,

  For whan a man mai redy finde
  His oghne wif, what scholde he seche
  In strange places to beseche                                    4220
  To borwe an other mannes plouh,
  Whan he hath geere good ynouh[1340]
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 234=]
  Affaited at his oghne heste,
  And is to him wel more honeste
  Than other thing which is unknowe?
  Forthi scholde every good man knowe
  And thenke, hou that in mariage
  His trouthe plight lith in morgage,
  Which if he breke, it is falshode,
  And that descordeth to manhode,                                 4230
  And namely toward the grete,
  Wherof the bokes alle trete;
  So as the Philosophre techeth
  To Alisandre, and him betecheth
  The lore hou that he schal mesure
  His bodi, so that no mesure
  Of fleisshly lust he scholde excede.
  And thus forth if I schal procede,
  The fifte point, as I seide er,[1341]
  Is chastete, which sielde wher                                  4240
  Comth nou adaies into place;
  And natheles, bot it be grace
  Above alle othre in special,
  Is non that chaste mai ben all.
  Bot yit a kinges hihe astat,[1342]
  Which of his ordre as a prelat
  Schal ben enoignt and seintefied,
  He mot be more magnefied
  For dignete of his corone,
  Than scholde an other low persone,                              4250
  Which is noght of so hih emprise.
  Therfore a Prince him scholde avise,                         (4450*)
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 235=]
  Er that he felle in such riote,
  And namely that he nassote
  To change for the wommanhede
  The worthinesse of his manhede.
      [Sidenote: Nota de doctrina Aristotilis, qualiter Princeps,
      vt animi sui iocunditatem prouocet, mulieres formosas

      torpescens ex carnis fragilitate in vicium dilabatur.]
    Of Aristotle I have wel rad,
  Hou he to Alisandre bad,
  That forto gladen his corage
  He schal beholde the visage                                     4260
  Of wommen, whan that thei ben faire.
  Bot yit he set an essamplaire,[1343]
  His bodi so to guide and reule,
  That he ne passe noght the reule,
  Wherof that he himself beguile.
  For in the womman is no guile[1344]
  Of that a man himself bewhapeth;
  Whan he his oghne wit bejapeth,
  I can the wommen wel excuse:[1345]
  Bot what man wole upon hem muse                                 4270
  After the fool impression
  Of his ymaginacioun,
  Withinne himself the fyr he bloweth,
  Wherof the womman nothing knoweth,
  So mai sche nothing be to wyte.
  For if a man himself excite
  To drenche, and wol it noght forbere,[1346]
  The water schal no blame bere.
  What mai the gold, thogh men coveite?
  If that a man wol love streite,                                 4280
  The womman hath him nothing bounde;
  If he his oghne herte wounde,
                                              [Sidenote: =P. iii 236=]
  Sche mai noght lette the folie;
  And thogh so felle of compainie
  That he myht eny thing pourchace,

  That he fulofte sithe is falle                                  4290
  Wher that he mai noght wel aryse.
  And natheles ful manye wise
  Befoled have hemself er this,
  As nou adaies yit it is
  Among the men and evere was,
  The stronge is fieblest in this cas.
  It sit a man be weie of kinde
  To love, bot it is noght kinde
  A man for love his wit to lese:
  For if the Monthe of Juil schal frese                           4300
  And that Decembre schal ben hot,
  The yeer mistorneth, wel I wot.                              (4500*)
  To sen a man fro his astat
  Thurgh his sotie effeminat,
  And leve that a man schal do,
  It is as Hose above the Scho,
  To man which oghte noght ben used.
  Bot yit the world hath ofte accused
  Ful grete Princes of this dede,
  Hou thei for love hemself mislede,                              4310

  With such a wounde him hath thurghsmite,
  That he mot nedes fiele and wite
  Of thilke blinde maladie,
  To which no cure of Surgerie
  Can helpe. Bot yit natheles
  At thilke time he hield his pes,

  So as he couthe in his manere,
  He spak and made frendly chiere,
  Til it was time forto go.
  And Collatin with him also
  His leve tok, so that be nyhte
  With al the haste that thei myhte

  Where he pourtreieth hire ymage:

  In which nature hadde alle grace
  Of wommanly beaute beset,
  So that it myhte noght be bet;[1402]                            4880

  And thus withinne himself to yelpe,
  As he which was a wylde man,
  Upon his treson he began:
  And up he sterte, and forth he wente
  On horsebak, bot his entente
  Ther knew no wiht, and thus he nam
  The nexte weie, til he cam                                      4910
  Unto Collacea the gate
  Of Rome, and it was somdiel late,

  And al frendliche he goth him in,[1408]                         4920
  As he that was cousin of house.
  And sche, which is the goode spouse,

  With goodli chiere drowh him nyh,
  As sche which al honour supposeth,
  And him, so as sche dar, opposeth
  Hou it stod of hire housebonde.

  And thus the trouthe was deceived
  With slih tresoun, which was received
  To hire which mente alle goode;

  So that thei alle abedde deiden,
  Whan thei her hand toward hir leiden,                           5350
  Noght for the lawe of Mariage,
  Bot for that ilke fyri rage                                  (5550*)
  In which that thei the lawe excede:
  For who that wolde taken hiede
  What after fell in this matiere,
  Ther mihte he wel the sothe hiere.
  Whan sche was wedded to Thobie,
  And Raphael in compainie
  Hath tawht him hou to ben honeste,
  Asmod wan noght at thilke feste,                         5360
  And yit Thobie his wille hadde;
  For he his lust so goodly ladde,
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 272=]
  That bothe lawe and kinde is served,
  Wherof he hath himself preserved,
  That he fell noght in the sentence.
  O which an open evidence[1443]
  Of this ensample a man mai se,

  Wel oghte him thanne in other weie                              5370
  Of lust to be the betre avised.
  For god the lawes hath assissed
  Als wel to reson as to kinde,
  Bot he the bestes wolde binde
  Only to lawes of nature,
  Bot to the mannes creature
  God yaf him reson forth withal,
  Wherof that he nature schal
  Upon the causes modefie,[1444]

  And yit he schal hise lustes have.
  So ben the lawes bothe save
  And every thing put out of sclandre;[1446]
  As whilom to king Alisandre
  The wise Philosophre tawhte,
  Whan he his ferste lore cawhte,
  Noght only upon chastete,
  Bot upon alle honestete;[1447]
  Wherof a king himself mai taste,
  Hou trewe, hou large, hou joust, hou chaste                     5390

  And is the laste of alle tho,

  Such lust is noght of loves kinde.
      [Sidenote: Confessio Amantis, vnde pro finali conclusione

    Mi fader, hou so that it stonde,
  Youre tale is herd and understonde,                             2030
  As thing which worthi is to hiere,
  Of gret ensample and gret matiere,
  Wherof, my fader, god you quyte.
  Bot in this point miself aquite
  I mai riht wel, that nevere yit
  I was assoted in my wit,
  Bot only in that worthi place
  Wher alle lust and alle grace
  Is set, if that danger ne were.
  Bot that is al my moste fere:                                   2040
  I not what ye fortune acompte,
  Bot what thing danger mai amonte
  I wot wel, for I have assaied;
  For whan myn herte is best arraied
  And I have al my wit thurghsoght
  Of love to beseche hire oght,
  For al that evere I skile may,[1681]
  I am concluded with a nay:
  That o sillable hath overthrowe
  A thousend wordes on a rowe                                     2050
  Of suche as I best speke can;
  Thus am I bot a lewed man.
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 344=]
  Bot, fader, for ye ben a clerk
  Of love, and this matiere is derk,
  And I can evere leng the lasse,
  Bot yit I mai noght let it passe,[1682]
  Youre hole conseil I beseche,
  That ye me be som weie teche
  What is my beste, as for an ende.
    Mi Sone, unto the trouthe wende                               2060
  Now wol I for the love of thee,
  And lete alle othre truffles be.[1683]

    The more that the nede is hyh,
  The more it nedeth to be slyh
                                  [Sidenote: [THE CONFESSOR REPLIES.]]
  To him which hath the nede on honde.
  I have wel herd and understonde,
  Mi Sone, al that thou hast me seid,
      [Sidenote: Hic super Amoris causa finita confessione,
      Confessor Genius Amanti ea que sibi salubrius expediunt,
      sano consilio finaliter iniungit.]
  And ek of that thou hast me preid,
  Nou at this time that I schal
  As for conclusioun final                                        2070
  Conseile upon thi nede sette:[1684]
  So thenke I finaly to knette
  This cause, where it is tobroke,
  And make an ende of that is spoke.[1685]
  For I behihte thee that yifte
  Ferst whan thou come under my schrifte,
  That thogh I toward Venus were,
  Yit spak I suche wordes there,
  That for the Presthod which I have,
  Min ordre and min astat to save,                                2080
  I seide I wolde of myn office
  To vertu more than to vice
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 345=]
  Encline, and teche thee mi lore.
  Forthi to speken overmore
  Of love, which thee mai availe,
  Tak love where it mai noght faile:[1686]
  For as of this which thou art inne,
  Be that thou seist it is a Sinne,
  And Sinne mai no pris deserve,
  Withoute pris and who schal serve,                              2090
  I not what profit myhte availe.
  Thus folweth it, if thou travaile,
  Wher thou no profit hast ne pris,
  Thou art toward thiself unwis:
  And sett thou myhtest lust atteigne,[1687]
  Of every lust thende is a peine,
  And every peine is good to fle;
  So it is wonder thing to se,[1688]
  Why such a thing schal be desired.
  The more that a Stock is fyred,                                 2100
  The rathere into Aisshe it torneth;
  The fot which in the weie sporneth
  Fulofte his heved hath overthrowe;
  Thus love is blind and can noght knowe[1689]
  Wher that he goth, til he be falle:
  Forthi, bot if it so befalle[1690]
  With good conseil that he be lad,
  Him oghte forto ben adrad.
  For conseil passeth alle thing
  To him which thenkth to ben a king;                             2110
  And every man for his partie
  A kingdom hath to justefie,
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 346=]
  That is to sein his oghne dom.
  If he misreule that kingdom,
  He lest himself, and that is more
  Than if he loste Schip and Ore
  And al the worldes good withal:
  For what man that in special
  Hath noght himself, he hath noght elles,
  Nomor the perles than the schelles;                             2120
  Al is to him of o value:
  Thogh he hadde at his retenue
  The wyde world riht as he wolde,
  Whan he his herte hath noght withholde
  Toward himself, al is in vein.
  And thus, my Sone, I wolde sein,
  As I seide er, that thou aryse,
  Er that thou falle in such a wise
  That thou ne myht thiself rekevere:
  For love, which that blind was evere,                           2130
  Makth alle his servantz blinde also.
  My Sone, and if thou have be so,
  Yit is it time to withdrawe,
  And set thin herte under that lawe,[1691]
  The which of reson is governed
  And noght of will. And to be lerned,
  Ensamples thou hast many on
  Of now and ek of time gon,[1692]
  That every lust is bot a while;
  And who that wole himself beguile,                              2140
  He may the rathere be deceived.
  Mi Sone, now thou hast conceived
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 347=]
  Somwhat of that I wolde mene;
  Hierafterward it schal be sene
  If that thou lieve upon mi lore;
  For I can do to thee nomore
  Bot teche thee the rihte weie:
  Now ches if thou wolt live or deie.

                                        [Sidenote: [THE CONTROVERSY.]]
    Mi fader, so as I have herd
  Your tale, bot it were ansuerd,                                 2150
      [Sidenote: Hic loquitur de controuersia, que inter
      Confessorem et Amantem in fine confessionis versabatur.]
  I were mochel forto blame.
  Mi wo to you is bot a game,
  That fielen noght of that I fiele;[1693]
  The fielinge of a mannes Hiele
  Mai noght be likned to the Herte:
  I mai noght, thogh I wolde, asterte,
  And ye be fre from al the peine
  Of love, wherof I me pleigne.
  It is riht esi to comaunde;
  The hert which fre goth on the launde                           2160
  Not of an Oxe what him eileth;
  It falleth ofte a man merveileth
  Of that he seth an other fare,
  Bot if he knewe himself the fare,
  And felt it as it is in soth,
  He scholde don riht as he doth,
  Or elles werse in his degre:
  For wel I wot, and so do ye,
  That love hath evere yit ben used,
  So mot I nedes ben excused.                                     2170
  Bot, fader, if ye wolde thus
  Unto Cupide and to Venus
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 348=]
  Be frendlich toward mi querele,
  So that myn herte were in hele
  Of love which is in mi briest,
  I wot wel thanne a betre Prest
  Was nevere mad to my behove.
  Bot al the whiles that I hove[1694]
  In noncertein betwen the tuo,[1695]
  And not if I to wel or wo[1696]                                 2180
  Schal torne, that is al my drede,
  So that I not what is to rede.
  Bot for final conclusion
  I thenke a Supplicacion
  With pleine wordes and expresse
  Wryte unto Venus the goddesse,
  The which I preie you to bere
  And bringe ayein a good ansuere.
  Tho was betwen mi Prest and me
  Debat and gret perplexete:                                      2190
  Mi resoun understod him wel,
  And knew it was soth everydel
  That he hath seid, bot noght forthi
  Mi will hath nothing set therby.
  For techinge of so wis a port[1697]
  Is unto love of no desport;
  Yit myhte nevere man beholde
  Reson, wher love was withholde,
  Thei be noght of o governance.
  And thus we fellen in distance,                                 2200
  Mi Prest and I, bot I spak faire,
  And thurgh mi wordes debonaire
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 349=]
  Thanne ate laste we acorden,[1698]
  So that he seith he wol recorden
  To speke and stonde upon mi syde
  To Venus bothe and to Cupide;
  And bad me wryte what I wolde,
  And seith me trewly that he scholde
  Mi lettre here unto the queene.
  And I sat doun upon the grene                                   2210
                                       [Sidenote: [THE SUPPLICATION.]]
  Fulfilt of loves fantasie,
  And with the teres of myn ÿe
  In stede of enke I gan to wryte
  The wordes whiche I wolde endite[1699]
  Unto Cupide and to Venus,
  And in mi lettre I seide thus.

    The wofull peine of loves maladie,
      [Sidenote: Hic tractat formam cuiusdam Supplicacionis, quam
      ex parte Amantis per manus Genii Sacerdotis sui Venus sibi
      porrectam acceptabat.]
  Ayein the which mai no phisique availe,
  Min herte hath so bewhaped with sotie,
  That wher so that I reste or I travaile,[1700]                  2220
  I finde it evere redy to assaile
  Mi resoun, which that can him noght defende:
  Thus seche I help, wherof I mihte amende.

  Ferst to Nature if that I me compleigne,
  Ther finde I hou that every creature
  Som time ayer hath love in his demeine,
  So that the litel wrenne in his mesure
  Hath yit of kinde a love under his cure;[1701]
  And I bot on desire, of which I misse:
  And thus, bot I, hath every kinde his blisse.                   2230

                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 350=]
  The resoun of my wit it overpasseth,
  Of that Nature techeth me the weie
  To love, and yit no certein sche compasseth
  Hou I schal spede, and thus betwen the tweie
  I stonde, and not if I schal live or deie.
  For thogh reson ayein my will debate,
  I mai noght fle, that I ne love algate.

  Upon miself is thilke tale come,
  Hou whilom Pan, which is the god of kinde,
  With love wrastlede and was overcome:[1702]                     2240
  For evere I wrastle and evere I am behinde,
  That I no strengthe in al min herte finde,
  Wherof that I mai stonden eny throwe;
  So fer mi wit with love is overthrowe.

  Whom nedeth help, he mot his helpe crave,
  Or helpeles he schal his nede spille:
  Pleinly thurghsoght my wittes alle I have,[1703]
  Bot non of hem can helpe after mi wille;
  And als so wel I mihte sitte stille,
  As preie unto mi lady eny helpe:                                2250
  Thus wot I noght wherof miself to helpe.[1704]

  Unto the grete Jove and if I bidde,
  To do me grace of thilke swete tunne,
  Which under keie in his celier amidde
  Lith couched, that fortune is overrunne,
  Bot of the bitter cuppe I have begunne,
  I not hou ofte, and thus finde I no game;[1705]
  For evere I axe and evere it is the same.

                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 351=]
  I se the world stonde evere upon eschange,
  Nou wyndes loude, and nou the weder softe;                      2260
  I mai sen ek the grete mone change,
  And thing which nou is lowe is eft alofte;
  The dredfull werres into pes fulofte
  Thei torne; and evere is Danger in o place,
  Which wol noght change his will to do me grace.

  Bot upon this the grete clerc Ovide,
  Of love whan he makth his remembrance,
  He seith ther is the blinde god Cupide,
  The which hath love under his governance,
  And in his hond with many a fyri lance[1706]                    2270
  He woundeth ofte, ther he wol noght hele;
  And that somdiel is cause of mi querele.[1707]

  Ovide ek seith that love to parforne
  Stant in the hond of Venus the goddesse,
  Bot whan sche takth hir conseil with Satorne,
  Ther is no grace, and in that time, I gesse,
  Began mi love, of which myn hevynesse
  Is now and evere schal, bot if I spede:
  So wot I noght miself what is to rede.

  Forthi to you, Cupide and Venus bothe,                          2280
  With al myn hertes obeissance I preie,
  If ye were ate ferste time wrothe,
  Whan I began to love, as I you seie,
  Nou stynt, and do thilke infortune aweie,[1708]
  So that Danger, which stant of retenue
  With my ladi, his place mai remue.

                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 352=]
  O thou Cupide, god of loves lawe,

  For Service in thi Court withouten hyre
  To me, which evere yit have kept thin heste,
  Mai nevere be to loves lawe honeste.

  O thou, gentile Venus, loves queene,[1709]
  Withoute gult thou dost on me thi wreche;
  Thou wost my peine is evere aliche grene
  For love, and yit I mai it noght areche:
  This wold I for my laste word beseche,[1710]
  That thou mi love aquite as I deserve,
  Or elles do me pleinly forto sterve.                            2300

                      [Sidenote: [VENUS REPLIES TO THE SUPPLICATION.]]

  Noght full the montance of a Mile,

  In such acord and such a soun

    Ther was Tristram, which was believed                         2500
  With bele Ysolde, and Lancelot
  Stod with Gunnore, and Galahot
  With his ladi, and as me thoghte,

  He peyneth him to make chiere

    Theseüs, thogh he were untrewe
  To love, as alle wommen knewe,
  Yit was he there natheles
  With Phedra, whom to love he ches:

  Fro Colchos, and the Cite nam                                   2520
  In vengance of the ferste hate;
  That made hem after to debate,
  Whan Priamus the newe toun
  Hath mad. And in avisioun
    Me thoghte that I sih also
  Ector forth with his brethren tuo;
  Himself stod with Pantaselee,
  And next to him I myhte se,
  Wher Paris stod with faire Eleine,
  Which was his joie sovereine;                                   2530
  And Troilus stod with Criseide,
  Bot evere among, althogh he pleide,
  Be semblant he was hevy chiered,
  For Diomede, as him was liered,
  Cleymeth to ben his parconner.
  And thus full many a bacheler,
  A thousend mo than I can sein,
  With Yowthe I sih ther wel besein
  Forth with here loves glade and blithe.
    And some I sih whiche ofte sithe                              2540
  Compleignen hem in other wise;
  Among the whiche I syh Narcise
  And Piramus, that sory were.[1737]
  The worthy Grek also was there,
  Achilles, which for love deide:
  Agamenon ek, as men seide,
                                             [Sidenote: =P. iii. 361=]
  And Menelay the king also
  I syh, with many an other mo,
  Which hadden be fortuned sore
  In loves cause.
                  And overmore                                    2550
  Of wommen in the same cas,
  With hem I sih wher Dido was,
  Forsake which was with Enee;
  And Phillis ek I myhte see,
  Whom Demephon deceived hadde;
  And Adriagne hir sorwe ladde,
  For Theseüs hir Soster tok
  And hire unkindely forsok.
  I sih ther ek among the press
  Compleignende upon Hercules                                     2560
  His ferste love Deyanire,
  Which sette him afterward afyre:
  Medea was there ek and pleigneth
  Upon Jason, for that he feigneth,
  Withoute cause and tok a newe;
  Sche seide, ‘Fy on alle untrewe!’
  I sih there ek Deÿdamie,
  Which hadde lost the compaignie
  Of Achilles, whan Diomede
  To Troie him fette upon the nede.                               2570
    Among these othre upon the grene

  With Serpentz hath hirself begrave
  Alquik, and so sche was totore,[1739]

  Which on the scharpe swerdes point
  For love deide in sory point;                                   2580
  And as myn Ere it myhte knowe,
  She seide, ‘Wo worthe alle slowe!’
  The pleignte of Progne and Philomene
  Ther herde I what it wolde mene,
  How Tereüs of his untrouthe
  Undede hem bothe, and that was routhe;
  And next to hem I sih Canace,
  Which for Machaire hir fader grace
  Hath lost, and deide in wofull plit.
  And as I sih in my spirit,                                      2590
  Me thoghte amonges othre thus
  The doghter of king Priamus,
  Polixena, whom Pirrus slowh,
  Was there and made sorwe ynowh,
  As sche which deide gulteles
  For love, and yit was loveles.
    And forto take the desport,
  I sih there some of other port,[1740]
  And that was Circes and Calipse,
  That cowthen do the Mone eclipse,                               2600
  Of men and change the liknesses,
  Of Artmagique Sorceresses;
  Thei hielde in honde manyon,
  To love wher thei wolde or non.
    Bot above alle that ther were
  Of wommen I sih foure there,

  Whos name I herde most comended:
  Be hem the Court stod al amended;
  For wher thei comen in presence,
  Men deden hem the reverence,                                    2610
  As thogh they hadden be goddesses,
  Of al this world or Emperesses.
  And as me thoghte, an Ere I leide,
  And herde hou that these othre seide,
  ‘Lo, these ben the foure wyves,
  Whos feith was proeved in her lyves:
  For in essample of alle goode

  That fame, which no gret thing hydeth,
  Yit in Cronique of hem abydeth.’                                2620
    Penolope that on was hote,
  Whom many a knyht hath loved hote,
  Whil that hire lord Ulixes lay[1741]
  Full many a yer and many a day
  Upon the grete Siege of Troie:
  Bot sche, which hath no worldes joie
  Bot only of hire housebonde,
  Whil that hir lord was out of londe,
  So wel hath kept hir wommanhiede,
  That al the world therof tok hiede,                             2630

  As sche which was on of the beste.
    The thridde wif was hote Alceste,                             2640
  Which whanne Ametus scholde dye
  Upon his grete maladye,
  Sche preide unto the goddes so,
  That sche receyveth al the wo
  And deide hirself to yive him lif:
  Lo, if this were a noble wif.[1742]

  I herde of hem that were nyh
  Hou sche was cleped Alcione,
  Which to Seyix hir lord al one[1743]                            2650
  And to nomo hir body kepte;
  And whan sche sih him dreynt, sche lepte
  Into the wawes where he swam,[1744]
  And there a Sefoul sche becam,
  And with hire wenges him bespradde
  For love which to him sche hadde.[1745]
    Lo, these foure were tho
  Whiche I sih, as me thoghte tho,
  Among the grete compaignie
  Which Love hadde forto guye:                                    2660
  Bot Youthe, which in special
  Of Loves Court was Mareschal,
  So besy was upon his lay,
  That he non hiede where I lay[1746]
  Hath take. And thanne, as I behield,
    Me thoghte I sih upon the field,

  Bot noght so manye as Youthe hadde:[1747]                       2670
  The moste part were of gret Age,
  And that was sene in the visage,[1748]
  And noght forthi, so as thei myhte,
  Thei made hem yongly to the sihte:
  Bot yit herde I no pipe there[1749]
  To make noise in mannes Ere,[1750]
  Bot the Musette I myhte knowe,
  For olde men which souneth lowe,[1751]
  With Harpe and Lute and with Citole.
  The hovedance and the Carole,                                   2680
  In such a wise as love hath bede,
  A softe pas thei dance and trede;
  And with the wommen otherwhile
  With sobre chier among thei smyle,
  For laghtre was ther non on hyh.
  And natheles full wel I syh
  That thei the more queinte it made
  For love, in whom thei weren glade.
    And there me thoghte I myhte se
  The king David with Bersabee,                                   2690
  And Salomon was noght withoute;
  Passende an hundred on a route
  Of wyves and of Concubines,
  Juesses bothe and Sarazines,[1752]

  Which love with his hond enseleth,
  Fro whom non erthly man appeleth.                               2700
  And overthis, as for a wonder,[1754]
  With his leon which he put under,[1755]
  With Dalida Sampson I knew,
  Whos love his strengthe al overthrew.
    I syh there Aristotle also,
  Whom that the queene of Grece so[1756]
  Hath bridled, that in thilke time
  Sche made him such a Silogime,
  That he foryat al his logique;
  Ther was non art of his Practique,                              2710
  Thurgh which it mihte ben excluded
  That he ne was fully concluded
  To love, and dede his obeissance.
  And ek Virgile of aqueintance
  I sih, wher he the Maiden preide,
  Which was the doghter, as men seide,
  Of themperour whilom of Rome;
  Sortes and Plato with him come,
  So dede Ovide the Poete.
  I thoghte thanne how love is swete,                             2720
  Which hath so wise men reclamed,
  And was miself the lasse aschamed,
  Or forto lese or forto winne
  In the meschief that I was inne:
  And thus I lay in hope of grace.
    And whan thei comen to the place

  So gret a clamour as was there,
  Let Pite come into hire Ere;
  And forth withal unto Cupide
  Sche preith that he upon his side

  And thus for me thei preiden alle
  Of hem that weren olde aboute,
  And ek some of the yonge route,                                 2740
  Of gentilesse and pure trouthe

  That I withouten help so ferde.
  And thus me thoghte I lay and herde.

  Of his eternal providence
  Hath mad, and thilke intelligence[1821]
  In mannes soule resonable
  Enspired to himself semblable,
  Wherof the man of his feture
  Above alle erthly creature[1822]
  After the soule is immortal,
  To thilke lord in special,                                     2980*
  As he which is of alle thinges
  The creatour, and of the kinges
  Hath the fortunes upon honde,[1823]
  His grace and mercy forto fonde
  Upon mi bare knees I preye,
  That he my worthi king conveye,

  In his persone it mai be schewed
  What is a king to be wel thewed,
  Touchinge of pite namely:
                                     [Sidenote: [THE KING COMMENDED.]]
  For he yit nevere unpitously

  For no defaute which he fond,
  Thurgh cruelte vengaunce soghte;
  And thogh the worldes chaunce in broghte[1827]
  Of infortune gret debat,
  Yit was he not infortunat:                                     3000*
  For he which the fortune ladde,
  The hihe god, him overspradde
  Of his Justice, and kepte him so,[1828]
  That his astat stood evere mo
  Sauf, as it oghte wel to be;[1829]
  Lich to the Sonne in his degree,
  Which with the clowdes up alofte
  Is derked and bischadewed ofte,[1830]
  But hou so that it trowble in their,[1831]
  The Sonne is evere briht and feir,                             3010*
  Withinne himself and noght empeired:[1832]
  Althogh the weder be despeired,
  The hed planete is not to wite.[1833]
  Mi worthi prince, of whom I write,
  Thus slant he with himselve clier,[1834]
  And doth what lith in his power[1835]
  Not only hier at hom to seke[1836]
  Love and acord, but outward eke,[1837]
  As he that save his poeple wolde.
  So ben we alle wel beholde[1838]                               3020*
  To do service and obeyssaunce
  To him, which of his heyh suffraunce[1839]
  Hath many a gret debat appesed,[1840]
  To make his lige men ben esed;[1841]
  Wherfore that his Croniqe schal
  For evere be memorial
  To the loenge of that he doth.[1842]
  For this wot every man in soth,
  What king that so desireth pes,[1843]
  He takth the weie which Crist ches:                            3030*
  And who that Cristes weies sueth,
  It proveth wel that he eschueth
  The vices and is vertuous,[1844]
  Wherof he mot be gracious
  Toward his god and acceptable.
  And so to make his regne stable,[1845]
  With al the wil that I mai yive
  I preie and schal whil that I live,
  As I which in subjeccioun
  Stonde under the proteccioun,[1846]                            3040*
  And mai miselven not bewelde,[1847]
  What for seknesse and what for elde,[1848]
  Which I receyve of goddes grace.
  But thogh me lacke to purchace
               [Sidenote: [THE AUTHOR PRESENTS HIS BOOK TO THE KING.]]
  Mi kinges thonk as by decerte,[1849]
  Yit the Simplesce of mi poverte

  And for this cause in myn entente
  This povere bok heer I presente[1850]                          3050*
  Unto his hihe worthinesse,
  Write of my simple besinesse,[1851]
  So as seknesse it suffre wolde.[1852]
  And in such wise as I ferst tolde,
  Whan I this bok began to make,[1853]
  In som partie it mai be take[1854]
  As for to lawhe and forto pleye;
  And forto loke in other weye,[1855]
  It mai be wisdom to the wise:
  So that somdel for good aprise[1856]                           3060*
  And eek somdel for lust and game[1857]
  I have it mad, as thilke same[1858]
  Which axe forto ben excused,[1859]
  That I no Rethoriqe have used
  Upon the forme of eloquence,
  For that is not of mi science;
  But I have do my trewe peyne
  With rude wordes and with pleyne
  To speke of thing which I have told.[1860]
                               [Sidenote: [FAREWELL TO EARTHLY LOVE.]]
    But now that I am feble and old,[1861]                       3070*
  And to the worschipe of mi king
  In love above alle other thing[1862]
  That I this bok have mad and write,[1863]
  Mi Muse doth me forto wite[1864]
  That it is to me for the beste
  Fro this day forth to take reste,[1865]
  That I nomore of love make.[1866]
  But he which hath of love his make[1867]
  It sit him wel to singe and daunce,[1868]
  And do to love his entendance                                  3080*
  In songes bothe and in seyinges
  After the lust of his pleyinges,
  For he hath that he wolde have:
  But where a man schal love crave[1869]
  And faile, it stant al otherwise.[1870]
  In his proverbe seith the wise,
  Whan game is best, is best to leve:[1871]
  And thus forthi my fynal leve,
  With oute makyng eny more,[1872]
  I take now for evere more                                      3090*
  Of love and of his dedly hele,[1873]
  Which no phisicien can hele.
  For his nature is so divers,
  That it hath evere som travers
  Or of to moche or of to lite,
  That fully mai noman delyte,
  But if him lacke or that or this.[1874]
  But thilke love which that is
  Withinne a mannes herte affermed,
                                          [Sidenote: [HEAVENLY LOVE.]]
  And stant of charite confermed,                                3100*
  That love is of no repentaile;
  For it ne berth no contretaile,
  Which mai the conscience charge,
  But it is rather of descharge,[1875]
  And meedful heer and overal.
  Forthi this love in special[1876]
  Is good for every man to holde,[1877]
  And who that resoun wol beholde,[1878]
  Al other lust is good to daunte:
  Which thing the hihe god us graunte[1879]                      3110*
  Forth with the remenant of grace
  So that of hevene in thilke place
  Wher resteth love and alle pes,[1880]
  Oure joye mai ben endeles.[1881]

TO KING HENRY THE FOURTH[1902]

IN PRAISE OF PEACE[1903]


  [1904]_Electus Cristi, pie Rex Henrice, fuisti,_
  _Qui bene venisti cum propria regna petisti;_
  _Tu mala vicisti que bonis bona restituisti,_
  _Et populo tristi noua gaudia contribuisti._
  _Est michi spes lata quod adhuc per te renouata_
  _Succedent fata veteri probitate beata,_
    _Est tibi nam grata gracia sponte data._

    O worthi noble kyng, Henry the ferthe,[1905]
  In whom the glade fortune is befalle
  The poeple to governe uppon this erthe,[1906]
  God hath the chose in comfort of ous alle:[1907]
  The worschipe of this lond, which was doun falle,[1908]
  Now stant upriht thurgh grace of thi goodnesse,
  Which every man is holde forto blesse.

  The highe god of his justice allone
  The right which longeth to thi regalie
  Declared hath to stonde in thi persone,                           10
  And more than god may no man justefie.
  Thi title is knowe uppon thin ancestrie,
  The londes folk hath ek thy riht affermed;
  So stant thi regne of god and man confermed.

  Ther is no man mai seie in other wise,
  That god himself ne hath thi riht declared,[1909]
  Whereof the lond is boun to thi servise,[1910]
  Which for defalte of help hath longe cared:
  Bot now ther is no mannes herte spared
  To love and serve and wirche thi plesance,                        20
  And al is this thurgh godes pourveiance.[1911]

  In alle thing which is of god begonne
  Ther folwith grace, if it be wel governed:
  Thus tellen thei whiche olde bookes conne,
  Whereof, my lord, y wot wel thow art lerned.
  Axe of thi god, so schalt thou noght be werned
  Of no reqweste which is resonable;
  For god unto the goode is favorable.

  Kyng Salomon, which hadde at his axinge
  Of god what thing him was levest to crave,[1912]                  30
  He ches wisdom unto the governynge[1913]
  Of goddis folk, the whiche he wolde save:
  And as he ches it fel him forto have;
  For thurgh his wit, whil that his regne laste,
  He gat him pees and reste unto the laste.[1914]

  Bot Alisaundre, as telleth his histoire,[1915]
  Unto the god besoghte in other weie,
  Of all the world to winne the victoire,
  So that undir his swerd it myht obeie.
  In werre he hadde al that he wolde preie,                         40
  The myghti god behight him that beheste,
  The world he wan, and had it of conqweste.[1916]

  Bot thogh it fel at thilke time so,
  That Alisandre his axinge hath achieved,
  This sinful world was al paiene tho,[1917]
  Was non which hath the hihe god believed:
  No wondir was thogh thilke world was grieved,
  Thogh a tiraunt his pourpos myhte winne;
  Al was vengance and infortune of sinne.

  Bot now the feith of Crist is come a place                        50
  Among the princes in this erthe hiere,
  It sit hem wel to do pite and grace;
  Bot yit it mot be tempred in manere:
  For as thei finden cause in the matiere[1918]
  Uppon the point, what aftirward betide,
  The lawe of riht schal noght be leid aside.

  So mai a kyng of werre the viage
  Ordeigne and take, as he therto is holde,
  To cleime and axe his rightful heritage
  In alle places wher it is withholde:                              60
  Bot other wise if god himsilve wolde
  Afferme love and pes betwen the kynges,
  Pes is the beste above alle erthely thinges.[1919]

  Good is teschue werre, and natheles
  A kyng may make werre uppon his right,
  For of bataile the final ende is pees.
  Thus stant the lawe, that a worthi knyght
  Uppon his trouthe may go to the fight;
  Bot if so were that he myghte chese,
  Betre is the pees, of which may no man lese.                      70

  <Sustene> pes oghte every man alyve,[1920]
  First for to sette his liege lord in reste,
  And ek these othre men that thei ne stryve;
  For so this world mai stonden ate beste.[1921]
  What kyng that wolde be the worthieste,
  The more he myghte oure dedly werre cesse,
  The more he schulde his worthinesse encresse.

  Pes is the chief of al the worldes welthe,
  And to the heven it ledeth ek the weie;
  Pes is of soule and lif the mannes helthe,                        80
  Of pestilence and doth the werre aweie.
  Mi liege lord, tak hiede of that y seie,
  If werre may be left, tak pes on honde,
  Which may noght be withoute goddis sonde.

  With pes stant every creature in reste;
  Withoute pes ther may no lif be glad:
  Above alle othre good pes is the beste,
  Pes hath himself whan werre is al bestad,
  The pes is sauf, the werre is evere adrad:[1922]
  Pes is of alle charite the keie,[1923]                            90
  Which hath the lif and soule forto weie.

  My liege lord, if that the list to seche
  The sothe essamples that the werre hath wroght,[1924]
  Thow schalt wiel hiere of wisemennes speche
  That dedly werre turneth into noght.
  For if these olde bokes be wel soght,[1925]
  Ther myght thou se what thing the werre hath do,
  Bothe of conqueste and conquerour also.

  For vein honour or for the worldes good
  Thei that whilom the stronge werres made,                        100
  Wher be thei now? Bethenk wel in thi mod.
  The day is goon, the nyght is derk and fade,
  Her crualte, which mad hem thanne glade,
  Thei sorwen now, and yit have noght the more;
  The blod is schad, which no man mai restore.

    =T=he werre is modir of the wronges alle;
  It sleth the prest in holi chirche at masse,
  Forlith the maide and doth hire flour to falle.[1926]
  The werre makth the grete Citee lasse,
  And doth the lawe his reules overpasse.                          110
  There is no thing wherof meschef mai growe
  Which is noght caused of the werre, y trowe.

  The werre bringth in poverte at hise hieles,
  Wherof the comon poeple is sore grieved;
  The werre hath set his cart on thilke whieles
  Wher that fortune mai noght be believed.
  For whan men wene best to have achieved,
  Ful ofte it is al newe to beginne:
  The werre hath no thing siker, thogh he winne.

  Forthi, my worthi prince, in Cristes halve,                      120
  As for a part whos feith thou hast to guide,[1927]
  Ley to this olde sor a newe salve,[1928]
  And do the werre awei, what so betide:
  Pourchace pes, and set it be thi side,[1929]
  And suffre noght thi poeple be devoured,
  So schal thi name evere after stonde honoured.[1930]

  If eny man be now or evere was[1931]
  Ayein the pes thi preve counseillour,
  Let god ben of thi counseil in this cas,[1932]
  And put awei the cruel werreiour.[1933]                          130
  For god, which is of man the creatour,
  He wolde noght men slowe his creature
  Withoute cause of dedly forfeture.

  Wher nedeth most, behoveth most to loke.
  Mi lord, how so thi werres ben withoute,
  Of time passed who that hiede toke,
  Good were at hom to se riht wel aboute;
  For everemor the werste is forto doute:
  Bot if thou myghtest parfit pes atteigne,
  Ther schulde be no cause forto pleigne.                          140

  Aboute a kyng good counseil is to preise
  Above alle othre thinges most vailable;
  Bot yit a kyng withinne himself schal peise,
  And se the thinges that ben resonable,
  And ther uppon he schal his wittes stable
  Among the men to sette pes in evene,
  For love of him which is the kyng of hevene.

    =H=a, wel is him that schedde nevere blod,[1934]
  Bot if it were in cause of rihtwisnesse:
  For if a kyng the peril undirstod,                               150
  What is to sle the poeple, thanne y gesse,
  The dedly werres and the hevynesse,
  Wherof the pes distourbid is ful ofte
  Schulde at som time cesse and wexe softe.

  O kyng fulfild of grace and of knyghthode,[1935]
  Remembre uppon this point for Cristes sake,
  If pes be profred unto thi manhode,
  Thin honour sauf, let it noght be forsake.
  Though thou the werres darst wel undirtake,
  Aftir reson yit tempre thi corage,                               160
  For lich to pes ther is non avantage.

  My worthi lord, thenk wel, how so befalle,[1936]
  Of thilke lore, as holi bokes sein,
  Crist is the heved and we ben membres alle,
  Als wel the subgit as the sovereign:[1937]
  So sit it wel that charite be plein,
  Which unto god himselve most acordeth,
  So as the lore of Cristes word recordeth.

  In tholde lawe, er Crist himself was bore,
  Among the ten comandementz y rede                                170
  How that manslaghtre schulde be forbore;
  Such was the will that time of the godhede:
  And aftirward, whanne Crist tok his manhede,[1938]
  Pes was the ferste thing he let do crie
  Ayein the worldes rancour and envie.[1939]

  And er Crist wente out of this erthe hiere,
  And stigh to hevene, he made his testament,[1940]
  Wher he beqwath to his disciples there
  And yaf his pes, which is the foundement
  Of charite, withouten whos assent                                180
  The worldes pes mai nevere wel be tried,[1941]
  Ne love kept, ne lawe justefied.

  The Jewes with the paiens hadden werre,[1942]
  Bot thei among hemself stode evere in pes:
  Whi schulde thanne oure pes stonde out of herre,[1943]
  Which Crist hath chose unto his oghne encres?
  For Crist is more than was Moïses,
  And Crist hath set the parfit of the lawe,
  The which scholde in no wise be withdrawe.

  To yive ous pes was cause whi Crist dide;                        190
  Withoute pes may no thing stonde availed:
  Bot now a man mai sen on everi side
  How Cristes feith is every dai assailed,[1944]
  With the Paiens destruid, and so batailed
  That for defalte of help and of defence
  Unethe hath Crist his dewe reverence.

    =T=he righte feith to kepe of holy chirche
  The firste point is named of knyghthode,
  And everi man is holde forto wirche
  Uppon the point which stant to his manhode.[1945]                200
  Bot now, helas, the fame is sprad so broode,
  That everi worthi man this thing compleigneth,[1946]
  And yit ther is no man which help ordeigneth.[1947]

  The worldes cause is waited overal,
  Ther ben the werres redi to the fulle;
  Bot Cristes oghne cause in special,
  Ther ben the swerdes and the speres dulle;
  And with the sentence of the popes bulle,
  As forto do the folk paien obeie,[1948]
  The chirche is turned al an other weie.                          210

  It is to wondre above a mannys wit[1949]
  Withoute werre how Cristes feith was wonne,
  And we that ben uppon this erthe yit
  Ne kepe it noght, as it was first begonne.
  To every creature undir the sonne
  Crist bad himself how that we schulden preche,[1950]
  And to the folk his evangile teche.

  More light it is to kepe than to make;
  Bot that we founden mad tofore the hond[1951]
  We kepe noght, bot lete it lightly slake.                        220
  The pes of Crist hath altobroke his bond,
  We reste ourselve and soeffrin every lond
  To slen ech other as thing undefendid:
  So stant the werre, and pes is noght amendid.

  Bot thogh the heved of holy chirche above
  Ne do noght al his hole businesse
  Among the men to sette pes and love,[1952]
  These kynges oughten of here rightwisnesse
  Here oghne cause among hemself redresse:
  Thogh Petres schip as now hath lost his stiere,                  230
  It lith in hem that barge forto stiere.

  If holy cherche after the duete
  Of Cristes word ne be noght al avysed
  To make pes, acord and unite
  Among the kinges that ben now devised,
  Yit natheles the lawe stant assised
  Of mannys wit to be so resonable,
  Withoute that to stonde hemselve stable.[1953]

  Of holy chirche we ben children alle,
  And every child is holden forto bowe                             240
  Unto the modir, how that evere it falle,[1954]
  Or elles he mot reson desalowe:
  And for that cause a knyght schal ferst avowe
  The right of holi chirche to defende,
  That no man schal the previlege offende.

  Thus were it good to setten al in evene
  The worldes princes and the prelatz bothe,
  For love of him which is the king of hevene:
  And if men scholde algate wexe wrothe,
  The Sarazins, whiche unto Crist be lothe,                        250
  Let men ben armed ayein hem to fighte;[1955]
  So mai the knyht his dede of armes righte.

    =U=ppon thre pointz stant Cristes pes oppressed:
  Ferst holy cherche is in hirsilf divided,[1956]
  Which oughte of reson first to be redresced;
  Bot yit so highe a cause is noght decided.
  And thus, whan humble pacience is prided,
  The remenant, which that thei schulden reule,
  No wondir is though it stonde out of reule.

  Of that the heved is siek, the limes aken:                       260
  These regnes that to Cristes pes belongen
  For worldes good these dedly werres maken,
  Whiche helpeles as in balance hongen.[1957]
  The heved above hem hath noght undirfongen
  To sette pes, bot every man sleeth other,
  And in this wise hath charite no brother.

  The two defaltes bringen in the thridde,
  Of mescreantz, that sen how we debate,
  Betwen the two thei fallen in amidde,[1958]
  Wher now aldai thei finde an open gate.                          270
  Lo, thus the dedly werre stant algate;
  Bot evere y hope of King Henries grace
  That he it is which schal the pes embrace.

  My worthi noble prince and kyng enoignt,
  Whom god hath of his grace so preserved,
  Behold and se the world uppon this point,[1959]
  As for thi part that Cristes pes be served:
  So schal thin highe mede be deserved
  To him which al schal qwiten ate laste,
  For this lif hiere mai no while laste.                           280

  See Alisandre, Ector and Julius,
  See Machabeu, David and Josue,
  See Charlemeine, Godefroi, Arthus,[1960]
  Fulfild of werre and of mortalite.
  Here fame abit, bot al is vanite;
  For deth, which hath the werres under fote,
  Hath mad an ende of which ther is no bote.

  So mai a man the sothe wite and knowe,[1961]
  That pes is good for every king to have:
  The fortune of the werre is evere unknowe,                       290
  Bot wher pes is, ther ben the marches save.[1962]
  That now is up, to morwe is under grave;
  The mighti god hath alle grace in honde,
  With outen him pes mai nought longe stonde.[1963]

    =O=f the Tenetz to winne or lese a chace,[1964]
  Mai no lif wite er that the bal be ronne:
  Al stant in god, what thing men schal pourchace,
  Thende is in him er that it be begonne.
  Men sein the wolle, whanne it is wel sponne,
  Doth that the cloth is strong and profitable,                    300
  And elles it mai nevere be durable.[1965]

  The worldes chaunces uppon aventure
  Ben evere sett, bot thilke chaunce of pes
  Is so behoveli to the creature,
  That it above alle othre is piereles:[1966]
  Bot it mai noght be gete natheles[1967]
  Among the men to lasten eny while,
  Bot wher the herte is plein withoute guyle.

  The pes is as it were a sacrement
  Tofore the god, and schal with wordes pleine                     310
  Withouten eny double entendement
  Be treted, for the trouthe can noght feine:
  Bot if the men withinne hemself be veine,
  The substance of the pes may noght be trewe,
  Bot every dai it chaungeth uppon newe.

  Bot who that is of charite parfit,
  He voideth alle sleightes ferr aweie,
  And sett his word uppon the same plit,
  Wher that his herte hath founde a siker weie:
  And thus whan conscience is trewly weie,                         320
  And that the pes be handlid with the wise,[1968]
  It schal abide and stonde in alle wise.

  Thapostle seith, ther mai no lif be good
  Which is noght grounded uppon charite,
  For charite ne schedde nevere blod,
  So hath the werre as ther no proprite:
  For thilke vertu which is seid pite
  With charite so ferforth is aqweinted,
  That in hire may no fals semblant be peinted.[1969]

    =C=assodre, whos writinge is auctorized,                  330
  Seith, wher that pite reigneth, ther is grace,[1970]
  Thurgh which the pes hath al his welthe assised,
  So that of werre he dredeth no manace.
  Wher pite dwelleth, in the same place
  Ther mai no dedly cruelte sojorne,
  Wherof that merci schulde his weie torne.[1971]

  To se what pite forth with mercy doth,
  The croniqe is at Rome in thilke empire
  Of Constantin, which is a tale soth;
  Whan him was levere his oghne deth desire                        340
  Than do the yonge children to martire,
  Of crualte he lafte the querele,
  Pite he wroghte and pite was his hele.

  For thilke mannes pite which he dede
  God was pitous and mad him hol at al;[1972]
  Silvestre cam, and in the same stede
  Yaf him baptisme first in special,
  Which dide awai the sinne original,
  And al his lepre it hath so purified,
  That his pite for evere is magnified.[1973]                      350

  Pite was cause whi this emperour
  Was hol in bodi and in soule bothe,
  And Rome also was set in thilke honour
  Of Cristes feith, so that the lieve of lothe,
  Whiche hadden be with Crist tofore wrothe,
  Resceived weren unto Cristes lore:[1974]
  Thus schal pite be preised evermore.

    =M=y worthi liege lord, Henri be name,
  Which Engelond hast to governe and righte,
  Men oghten wel thi pite to proclame,                             360
  Which openliche in al the worldes sighte
  Is schewed with the help of god almighte,
  To yive ous pes, which longe hath be debated,
  Wherof thi pris shal nevere ben abated.

  My lord, in whom hath evere yit be founde[1975]
  Pite withoute spot of violence,
  Kep thilke pes alwei withinne bounde,
  Which god hath planted in thi conscience:
  So schal the cronique of thi pacience
  Among the seintz be take into memoire                            370
  To the loenge of perdurable gloire.[1976]

  And to thin erthli pris, so as y can,
  Which everi man is holde to commende,
  I, Gower, which am al thi liege man,
  This lettre unto thin excellence y sende,
  As y which evere unto my lives ende
  Wol praie for the stat of thi persone
  In worschipe of thi sceptre and of thi throne.[1977]

    =N=oght only to my king of pes y write,
  Bot to these othre princes cristene alle,                        380
  That ech of hem his oghne herte endite,
  And see the werre er more meschief falle:[1978]
  Sette ek the rightful Pope uppon his stalle,
  Kep charite and draugh pite to honde,
  Maintene lawe, and so the pes schal stonde.

=Explicit carmen de pacis commendacione, quod ad laudem et memoriam
serenissimi principis domini Regis Henrici quarti suus[1979] humilis
orator Iohannes Gower composuit.[1980] Et nunc sequitur epistola in
qua idem Ioannes pro statu et salute dicti domini sui apud altissitmum
deuocius exorat.=

  [1981]Rex celi deus et dominus, qui tempora solus
    Condidit, et solus condita cuncta regit;
  Qui rerum causas ex se produxit et vnum
    In se principium rebus inesse dedit;
  Qui dedit vt stabili motu consisteret orbis
    Fixus ineternum mobilitate sua;
  Quique potens verbi produxit ad esse creata,
    Quique sue mentis lege ligauit ea;
  Ipse caput regum, reges quo rectificantur,
    Te que tuum regnum, rex pie, queso, regat.[1982]                10
  Grata superueniens te misit gracia nobis,
    Quo sine labe salus nulla perante fuit.
  Sic tuus aduentus noua gaudia sponte reduxit,
    Quo prius in luctu lacrima maior erat:
  Nos tua milicies pauidos releuauit ab ymo,
    Quos prius oppressit ponderis omne malum:
  Ex probitate tua, quo mors latitabat in vmbra,
    Vita resurexit clara que regna regit:
  Sic tua sors sortem mediante deo renouatam
    Sanat et emendat, que prius egra fuit.                          20
  O pie rex, Cristum per te laudamus, et ipsum
    Qui tibi nos tribuit terra reuiua colit.
  Sancta sit illa dies qua tu tibi regna petisti,
    Sanctus et ille deus qui tibi regna dedit.
  Qui tibi prima tulit, confirmet regna futura,
    Quo poteris magno magnus honore frui.
  Sit tibi progenies ita multiplicata per euum,
    Quod genus inde pium repleat omne solum.
  Quicquid in orbe boni fuerit, tibi summus ab alto
    Donet, vt in terris rex in honore regas:                        30
  Omne quod est turpe vacuum discedat, et omne
    Est quod honorificum det deus esse tuum.
  Consilium nullum, pie rex, te tangat iniquum,
    In quibus occultum scit deus esse dolum.
  Absit auaricia, ne tangat regia corda,
    Nec queat in terra proditor esse tua.
  Sic tua processus habeat fortuna perhennes,
    Quo recolant laudes secula cuncta tuas:
  Nuper vt Augusti fuerant preconia Rome,[1983]
    Concinat in gestis Anglia leta tuis.                            40
  O tibi, rex, euo detur, fortissime, nostro
    Semper honorata sceptra tenere manu:
  Stes ita magnanimus quod, vbi tua regna gubernas,
    Terreat has partes hostica nulla manus:
  Augeat imperium tibi Cristus et augeat annos,
    Protegat et nostras aucta corona fores:
  Sit tibi pax finis, domito domineris in orbe,
    Cunctaque sint humeris inferiora tuis.[1984]
  Sic honor et virtus, laus, gloria, pax que potestas[1985]
    Te que tuum regnum magnificare queant.[1986]                    50
  Cordis amore boni, pie rex, mea vota paraui;
    Corpore cum nequii, seruio mente tibi:
  Ergo tue laudi que tuo genuflexus honori[1987]
    Verba loco doni pauper habenda tuli.
  Est tamen ista mei, pie rex, sentencia verbi,
    Fine tui regni sint tibi regna poli.

NOTES

LIB. V. (_continued_)


1980. F has a stop after ‘Avarice,’ but see note on l. 3966.

1982 ff. The meaning seems to be that they make no distinction of day
or night when there is work of this kind to be done.

2004. _overhippeth_, i. e. leaps over or omits something, so that he
has not all that he desires. The word is used in _Piers Plowman_, xv.
379, of omitting passages in the services of the Church.

2015 ff. Cp. _Mirour de l’Omme_, 6253 ff.,

  ‘Sicomme le Luce en l’eaue gloute
  Du piscon la menuse toute,
  Qu’il presde luy verra noer,
  Ensi ly riches,’ &c.

2031 ff. The tale of Virgil’s Mirror is from the French prose _Roman
des Sept Sages_, as published by Le Roux de Lincy. It might easily be
shown that Gower did not follow either the French metrical version or
the Latin _Historia Septem Sapientum_. The English metrical version
published by Weber is from a source similar to that of Gower’s story,
but it differs in some points. Gower seems to be responsible for the
introduction of Carthage and Hannibal.

2099. _slepende a nyht_, i. e. while they slept.

2101. Cp. Prol. 182.

2115. _he his oghne body_, i. e. ‘he himself.’

2150 f. This point is omitted in the English metrical version.

2157 f. The English metrical version is very similar, ‘We schulle the
ymage so undersette, That we ne schal hit nothing lette.’

2168. That is, the timber having been set up.

2198 ff. This about Hannibal is introduced here as if taken from a
different source, ‘For this I finde,’ &c.

2238f. Cp. _Mirour_, 10651, ‘Plus que gaigners son augst attent.’

2273 ff. The tale of the Two Coffers is essentially the same story
as that which we have in Boccaccio _Decam._ x. i, and essentially
different from that which is told in _Vit. Barlaam et Josaphat_, cap.
vi, as a sequel to the story of the Trump of Death. The story which we
have here and in Boccaccio is not at all connected with the idea of
choosing by the outward appearance. The coffers are exactly alike, and
the very point of the situation lies in the fact that the choice is a
purely fortuitous one. The object was to show that they who complained
were persons who had fortune against them, and that this was the cause
of their having failed of reward, and not any neglect on the part of
the king. I cannot say what the source was for Gower; certainly not
Boccaccio, whose story is altogether different in its details.

2391 ff. With this story may be compared that in the _Gesta Romanorum_,
109, where by a choice between three pasties, one containing money, a
decision is come to as to whether it is God’s will that a certain sum
shall be restored to its owner, who is a miser.

2476. _tall_, i. e. comely, elegant.

2481. Cp. Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, D 259.

2507. _His thonkes_, ‘of his own good will’: cp. Chaucer, _Cant.
Tales_, A 1626, &c.

2543 ff. See _Hist. Alexandri Magni de Preliis_, f 1, ed. Argent. 1489.

2547 ff. _Rom. de Troie_, 23283 ff.

2563. Cp. ii. 2025.

2587. ‘If men shall estimate her value.’ The reading of the text is
also that of S.

2643 ff. This story is to be found in the _Roman des Sept Sages_. Gower
follows the same French prose version as before, 2031 ff.

2677. _it stod._ In this kind of expression the verb is usually
subjunctive, as Prol. 481, i. 991, iv. 182, &c.

2752. _a weie._ This is also the reading of S.

2815 f. A rather more violent displacement than usual of the
conjunction, ‘And fled away with all the haste,’ &c. Cp. l. 3947.

2835. _hele_ seems here to mean ‘profit,’ in a worldly sense.

2872. According to the _New Engl. Dict._ this is the same as the Dutch
‘heepe,’ ‘heep,’ meaning a pruning-hook. ‘As there is no cognate word
in O. E., its appearance in Gower, and this apparently in a proverbial
phrase, is not easy to account for.’ In any case the phrase here seems
equivalent to ‘by hook or by crook.’

2937. F has punctuation after ‘dai,’ but this is clearly a case of the
inverted order of the conjunction: cp. note on Prol. 155, and below on
l. 3966.

2961 ff. The story is probably taken from Statius, _Achill._ i. 197
ff., where however it is told at much greater length. For Gower’s
acquaintance with the _Achilleis_, cp. iv. 1968 ff.

3002 ff. Cp. _Achill._ i. 338 ff.

3004 f. That is, howsoever his behaviour might be watched.

3082. _Protheüs._ According to Statius, _Achill._ i. 494 ff.,
Protesilaus rebuked Calchas for not having discovered Achilles, upon
which Calchas revealed the truth. Perhaps the mention of Protesilaus
suggested to Gower the idea of Proteus, of whom he had heard as one
who could change his form at will, see l. 6672, and perhaps as having
prophesied the birth and greatness of Achilles (Ovid, _Metam._ xi. 221
ff.).

3119. _topseilcole_, see note on viii. 1890.

3138 f. Cp. _Achill._ i. 812 ff.

3247 ff. The first part of the story of Jason and Medea (ll. 3247-3926)
is taken from Benoît (_Rom. de Troie_, 703-2062), and not from Guido,
as may be easily shown by comparison of the texts. For example, Guido
tells all the conditions of the enterprise, about the fire-breathing
bulls, the serpent’s teeth and so on, at the beginning of the story,
whereas Benoît more dramatically introduces them into the instructions
given to Jason by Medea (_Rom. de Troie_, 1337-1374, 1691-1748), and in
this he is followed by Gower (3505-3540). Guido says nothing about the
sleeplessness of the serpent (_Rom. de Troie_, 1357 f., _Conf. Am._ v.
3514), nor about repeating the charm ‘contre orient’ (_Rom. de Troie_,
1700), nor does he mention the thanksgiving which Jason is to offer up
to the gods after his victory and before he takes the fleece (_Rom. de
Troie_, 1735 f., _Conf. Am._ v. 3626 ff.). The sleep of Jason after
leaving Medea is omitted by Guido (_Rom. de Troie_, 1755 ff., _Conf.
Am._ v. 3665 ff.), and also the bath which he took after his adventure
(_Rom. de Troie_, 1999, _Conf. Am._ v. 3801). There is no need to
multiply instances, which will be observed by every careful reader. We
have seen on other occasions that Gower prefers Benoît to Guido, and
not without excellent reasons. Guido indeed makes this story even more
prosaic than usual, and combines it with matter-of-fact discussions
about the magic powers of Medea and the virtues of the various stones
which she used.

Gower, however, does not follow Benoît in a slavish manner. He omits or
alters the details of the story very happily at times, and he adds much
of his own. Thus he omits all mention of the evil motives of Peleus (or
Pelias), and makes the proposal to seek the golden fleece come from
Jason; he passes over the story of the dispute with Laomedon, which was
necessary to the _Roman de Troie_, but not to the story of Jason taken
separately; he adds the discourse of Jason with Oëtes on his arrival;
he omits the details about Medea’s hair and eyes, her arms and her chin
(_Rom. de Troie_, 1254 ff.), and dwells rather upon the feelings which
the two lovers had for one another at first sight (3376 ff.). When they
are together at night, it is Medea, according to our author, and not
Jason, who suggests that it is time to rise and to speak of what has to
be done (3547 ff.); and Gower adds the scene of parting (3634-3659),
the description of Jason’s return over the sea and of Medea’s feelings
meanwhile upon her tower, and the sending of the maid to inquire how
he did. Finally, he much improves the story by making the flight take
place at once, instead of prolonging Jason’s stay for a month.

Chaucer, who tells the story in a rather perfunctory manner, follows
Guido (_Leg. of Good Women_, 1396 ff.).

3291. _And schop anon_, &c. This might be understood of Peleus, who,
according to the original story, gave orders for the building of the
ship; but better perhaps of Jason, ‘And schop’ for ‘And he schop,’ cp.
l. 4590 and vi. 1636.

3376. _herd spoke_: cp. 4485, ‘I have herd seid.’

3388. That is, ‘they took heed each of other.’ For the plural verb cp.
3439.

3416. That is, ‘he took St. John as his pledge’ of a good issue, ‘he
committed himself to the care of St. John.’ The expression was often
used in connexion with setting out on a journey: cp. Chaucer, _Compl.
of Mars_, 9.

3422. Cp. iv. 3273, vi. 2104. The expression in vi. 1621 f., ‘to ful
age, That he can reson and langage,’ that is, ‘till he is of full age
and knows reason,’ &c., is much of the same kind.

3488. _dede him helpe._ We must take this second ‘helpe’ as a
substantive, otherwise the rhyme would not be good. The rule is that
words identical in form can only be combined in rhyme when they have
some difference of meaning.

3509. _to thyle._ The idea was that the golden fleece was guarded in
a small island adjacent to the larger ‘isle of Colchos.’ See _Rom. de
Troie_, 1791 ff.,

  ‘Ilec li covient à passer,
  Ou voille ou non, un bras de mer;
  Mès estreiz est, ne dure mie
  Gaires plus de lieue et demie.
  De l’altre part est li isliax,
  Non mie granz, mès molt est biax.’

3533. _dethes wounde_, ‘deadly wound’: cp. iii. 2657, ‘And smot him
with a dethes wounde,’ and also the genitives ‘lyves’ for ‘living’ and
‘worldes’ for ‘worldly,’ i. 1771, iv. 382, &c.

3573. _hold_, i. e. let him hold: cp. viii. 1128, 1420.

3579 ff. According to Benoît Medea gave him first the magic figure,
‘une figure Fete par art et par conjure’ (cp. 3580), then the ointment
and the ring, and after that a writing, the words of which he was
to repeat three times when he came to the place. Gower changes the
order of things, and combines the writing with the ‘hevenely figure,’
describing it as written over with names which he is to repeat in the
manner mentioned.

3632. _That thanne he were_, &c., that is, she prayed that he would
soon be gone.

3654. ‘It shall not be owing to any sloth of mine if I do not,’ &c.

3665 ff.

  ‘Dedanz son lit s’est tost cochiez
  Endormi sei en eslepas;
  Car tot esteit de veiller las:
  Et quant il ot dormi grant piece,
  Tant qu’il estoit ja halte tierce,
  Levez s’est,’ &c. _Rom. de Troie_, 1756 ff.

‘undren hih’ is in the French ‘halte tierce.’

3681. _recorde_, ‘take note of.’

3688. The reading of X here, ‘And forth with all his wey he fongeth,’
is also that of GOAd₂.

3707. _scherded_: perhaps the word is suggested by Benoît’s expression,
‘Les escherdes hérice’ (_Rom. de Troie_, 1905).

3711. A literal translation of _Rom. de Troie_, 1906, ‘Feu et venin
gitot ensenble.’ With the lines that follow cp. _Rom. de Troie_, 1911
ff.

3731 ff. The picturesque elements here are perhaps partly suggested by
_Rom. de Troie_, 1869 ff.

3747. _That he ne were_, expressing a wish: cp. iv. 3414, ‘Helas, that
I nere of this lif,’ equivalent to ‘why ne were I,’ l. 5979.

3781 f. ‘leyhe’ seems to be modified in form for the sake of the rhyme,
the usual form in Gower being ‘lawhe.’

3786. _naght_, in rhyme for ‘noght’: cp. ‘awht,’ ‘auht,’ i. 2770, v.
6073.

3789. So Ovid, _Metam._ vii. 144 ff.,

  ‘Tu quoque victorem complecti, barbara, velles,
  Obstitit incepto pudor,’ &c.,

but it is also in Benoît, _Rom. de Troie_, 1991 f.

3793 ff. The sending of the maid, with the pretty touch in l. 3800, is
an addition by Gower.

3890. Cp. i. 1516.

3904. _this was conseil_, ‘this was a secret’: cp. iii. 778, vi. 2326;
so Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, C 819, ‘Shal it be conseil?’ cp. D 966, E
2431.

3927 ff. Benoît tells no more of Jason’s life after his return to
Greece, saying that Dares relates no more, and he does not wish to tell
stories that may not be true, ‘N’en velt fere acreire mençonge.’ From
this point then Gower follows Ovid, _Metam._ vii. 159-293, and it must
be understood that the illustrative quotations in the notes are from
this passage.

3947. ‘And prayed her that by the magic art which she knew,’ &c. For
the order of words cp. 2815 f.

3957 f. Ovid makes it full moon, l. 180, but afterwards, l. 188, says
‘Sidera sola micant.’

3962 ff.

  ‘Egreditur tectis vestes induta recinctas,
  Nuda pedem, nudos humeris infusa capillos,
  Fertque vagos mediae per muta silentia noctis
  Incomitata gradus.’ _Metam._ vii. 182 ff.

The comparison to the adder in l. 3967 is Gower’s own.

3966. F has a stop after ‘specheles,’ there being a natural tendency
even in the best copies to treat ‘and’ or ‘for’ as the beginning of
a new clause: so (to take examples from the fifth book only) v. 231,
410, 444, 2318, 2937, 5096, in all which places F has apparently wrong
punctuation in connexion with this kind of inverted order.

3971 ff.

  ‘Ter se convertit, ter sumptis flumine crinem
  Irroravit aquis, ternis ululatibus ora
  Solvit’: 189 f.

3981. The punctuation is that of F, but perhaps we ought rather to read,

  ‘Sche preide and ek hield up hir hond,
  To Echates and gan to crie.’

3986. _help._ For this use of the imperat. sing, (with ‘helpeth’ just
above) see Introduction, p. cxviii.

3994.

  ‘Sublimis rapitur, subiectaque Thessala Tempe
  Despicit, et Creteis regionibus applicat angues:’ 222 f.

Gower very naturally understood this to mean that Medea visited Crete,
and hence the confusion of geography. He could not be expected to know
that Othrys and Olympus were mountains of Thessaly, and hence that the
‘Creteis’ or ‘cretis’ of his manuscript was probably a corruption.

4000 f.

      ‘et placitas partim radice revellit,
  Partim succidit curvamine falcis ahenae.’ 226 f.

4005. _Eridian_, i. e. Apidanus.

4006.

  ‘Necnon Peneus, necnon Spercheïdes undae
  Contribuere aliquid.’ 230 f.

4011. _the rede See._ Perhaps Gower read ‘rubrum mare’ for ‘refluum
mare’ in _Metam._ vii. 258.

4031 ff.

            ‘statuitque aras e caespite binas,
  Dexteriore Hecates, at laeva parte Iuventae.’ 240 f.

4039. ‘verbenis, silvaque incinxit agresti,’ 242. Gower took ‘silva
agrestis’ as the name of a herb and ingeniously translated it into
‘fieldwode.’

4052 f. ‘Umbrarumque rogat rapta cum coniuge regem,’ 249. Our author is
able to supply the names correctly.

4064-4114. This picturesque passage is for the most part original.

4127 ff. ‘Nec defuit illic Squamea Cinyphii tenuis membrana chelydri,’
272. Gower understood this to mean ‘the scales of Cinyphius (or
Cimphius) and _the_ skin of Chelidrus.’

4134. ‘novem cornicis saecula passae,’ 274.

4137. Ovid speaks of the entrails of a werwolf, ‘Ambigui prosecta
lupi,’ &c.

4156. For omission of relative cp. l. 4205 and note on i. 10.

4175 ff. The story here is only summarized by Ovid, _Metam._ vii.
394-401. Gower of course knew it from other sources.

4219. ‘intrat Palladias arces,’ _Metam._ vii. 398. This means Athens,
but it is misunderstood by Gower.

4251. _Philen_, i. e. Nephele. Hyginus tells this story much as it is
told here (except that it was the mother of the children who provided
the ram), but he gives the name in its Latin form, as ‘Nebula.’ Note
the mistake as to this name in the margin, appearing in all MSS. except
SΔΛ.

4299 ff. Note the confused construction of the sentence: cp. note on i.
98.

4391. The metaphor of hunting is still kept up: the gain which they
pursue is started like a hare and driven into the net.

4399. _Outward_, that is, when he gives things out, cp. ‘withinne’
below.

4452. _I were a goddeshalf._ This seems to mean, ‘I should be content,’
that is, I should be ready to say ‘In God’s name let it be so.’ For the
expression cp. l. 5016, ‘Thanne a goddes half The thridde time assaie
I schal.’ In the _New Engl. Dict._ (‘half’) it is said to be used ‘to
add emphasis _to_ a petition, command, or expression of consent or
resignation’: cp. Chaucer, _Book of the Duchess_, 370, 757.

4455. _I biede nevere ... Bot_, ‘I demand only.’ In this expression
‘biede’ and ‘bidde’ have been confused, as often. Thus we have ‘I bidde
nevere a betre taxe,’ i. 1556, ‘That I ne bede nevere awake,’ iv. 2905,
in the latter of which ‘bede’ may be either pret. subj. of ‘bidde,’ or
pres. ind. equivalent to ‘biede,’ and vi. 1356, ‘He bede nevere fare
bet’ where ‘bede’ is apparently pret. subj. of bidde; while in the
English _Rom. of the Rose_, 791, we have ‘Ne bode I nevere thennes go,’
in which ‘bode’ must be pret. subj. of ‘biede.’

4465. _lete_: see note on i. 3365.

4549 ff. Cp. i. 42 ff.

4557 f. ‘No law may control him either by severity or by mildness.’ For
the use of ‘compaignie’ in the sense of ‘friendliness’ cp. i. 1478, and
below, l. 7759.

4583 ff. Ovid, _Metam._ iii. 362 ff., but the circumstances are
somewhat modified to suit Gower’s purpose. According to Ovid Echo’s
fault was that she talked too much and diverted Juno’s attention, and
her punishment was that her speech was confined to a mere repetition of
what she heard. Here the crime is rather that she cunningly concealed
in her speech what she ought to have told, and the punishment is that
she is obliged to tell everything that comes to her ears.

4590. ‘And through such brocage he was untrue,’ &c. For the omission of
the pronoun see note on i. 1895.

4623. _maken it so queinte_, ‘be so cunning’: cp. iv. 2314, where
however ‘queinte’ has a different meaning.

4642. _hire mouth ascape_, i. e. escape being repeated by her mouth.

4661. The aspiration of ‘hem,’ so as to prevent elision, is very
unusual: cp. Introduction, p. cxxv.

4668 ff. ‘I shall arrange in their due order those branches of Avarice
on which no wealth is well bestowed,’ that is, those which make no
return for what is bestowed upon them, viz. Usury and Ingratitude.

4708. _of som reprise_, i. e. ‘of some cost,’ cp. i. 3414,

  ‘Which most is worth, and no reprise
  It takth ayein,’

that is, it costs nothing.

4724. _with ydel hand_, ‘with empty hand,’ that is, without a lure.
This seems to be the original meaning of the adjective: see _New Eng.
Dict._ ‘idle.’

4731. _the gold Octovien._ The treasures of Octovien (or Octavian) were
proverbial: cp. _Rom. de Troie_, 1684 f.,

  ‘Unques Oteviens de Rome
  Ne pot conquerre tel aveir,’

and again 28594,

  ‘Se li tresors Octoviens
  Fust lor, si lor donassent il.’

The expression here seems to be in imitation of the French form without
preposition, as in the latter of the above quotations.

The French _Roman d’Othevien_, found in the Bodleian MS. Hatton 100,
and reproduced in two English versions, has nothing to do with the
treasures of Octovien, for which see William of Malmesbury, _Gesta
Regum_, ii. § 169 f. The treasures were supposed to be buried at Rome
or elsewhere, and several persons, especially the Pope Silvester
(Gerbert), were said to have seen them, but not to have been permitted
to carry them away. They appear also in the _Roman des Sept Sages_.

4748. _eschu of._ The adjective is used by Chaucer with ‘to’ (or ‘for
to’) and infin., _Cant. Tales_, E 1812, I 971. We may note the spelling
here with reference to Chaucer’s rhyme in the former passage.

4763. ‘It may not by any means be avoided that,’ &c.

4774. _as to tho pars_, ‘as regards those matters’: ‘pars’ is the
French plural form, cp. _Mirour_, 7386, where apparently ‘pars’ means
‘duties.’

4787. Cp. l. 7716, where the saying has a different application. The
proverb is here used of those who are, as we say, penny wise and pound
foolish. In the other passage it is applied to the opposite case of
gaining the coat for the hood.

4808 ff. This story is founded on the so-called _Comedia Babionis_,
one of those Latin elegiac poems in a quasi-dramatic form which were
popular in the fourteenth century. Others of the same class are _Geta_
and _Pamphilus_. In the original, Viöla is Babio’s step-daughter, with
whom he is in love, and who is taken in marriage against his will by
Croceus. The serving-man is Fodius, not Spodius, and most of the piece
is concerned with an intrigue between him and the wife of Babio. See
Wright’s _Early Mysteries_, p. 65.

4899. _comth to londe_, ‘appears’: cp. l. 18.

4921. _who that it kan_, that is, as any one who knows it will witness:
cp. l. 4927, ‘For, as any one who observes may know, a beast is,’ &c.

4937 ff. This story, which is of Eastern origin, is told near the end
of the _Speculum Stultorum_ (i. e. _Burnellus_), with which Gower was
acquainted, as we know from the _Vox Clamantis_. The names there are
Bernardus and Dryānus, and the animals are three, a serpent, an ape,
and a lion. A similar tale is told by Matthew Paris, under the year
1195, as related by King Richard I in order to recommend liberality in
the cause of Christendom. In this the rich man is Vitalis, a Venetian,
and the poor man’s name is not given. The animals in the pit are a lion
and a serpent. Vitalis thanks his deliverer, and appoints a time for
him to come to his palace in Venice and receive the promised reward of
half his goods; but when he comes, he is refused with contumely. The
magic qualities of the gem which the serpent brings are not mentioned
in the story of Vitalis.

5010 f. So in the _Speculum Stultorum_, ‘Tunc ita Bernardus, Sathanae
phantasmate lusum Se reputans, dixit,’ &c.

5022. _blessed_, i. e. crossed himself. This ceremony plays a
considerable part in the story of Vitalis, for by it he is preserved
from the wild beasts while in the pit.

5025. _Betwen him and his Asse_, that is, he and his ass together: cp.
l. 5381. The expression is imitated from the French, cp. _Roman de
Troie_, 5837.

5093. There is a stop after ‘Purs,’ no doubt rightly, in F. On the
other hand the stop after ‘wif’ in l. 5096 must be wrong.

5123 f. Cp. 4597 ff.

5215. _standt._ For this spelling cp. ‘bidt,’ iv. 1162.

5231 ff. The outline of this story might have been got from Ovid and
from Hyginus, _Fab._ 40-43, but several points of detail suggest a
different source. These are, for example, the idea that the son of
Minos went to Athens to study philosophy, the statement of the number
of persons sent as a tribute to Minos, the incident of the ball of
pitch given by Ariadne to Theseus to be used against the Minotaur,
and the name of the island where Ariadne was deserted. In the first
and third of these Gower agrees with Chaucer, _Legend of Good Women_,
1894 ff., but his story is apparently quite independent, so that in
regard to, these matters we must assume a common source: cp. L. Bech in
_Anglia_, v. 337 ff.

_as telleth the Poete._ The authority referred to here must be Ovid
(cp. i. 386, ii. 121, v. 6713, 6804, &c.). He slightly mentions the
death of Androgeus, _Metam._ vii. 458, and relates the war of Minos
against Megara at some length (_Metam._ viii. 1 ff), very briefly
summarising the remainder of the story. Chaucer follows Ovid more fully
here, telling the story of Nisus, to which Gower does not think it
necessary to refer.

5248. _dighte._ This is the form of spelling here in S as well as F: so
also in l. 5352.

5264 f. Hyginus says seven persons each year: Chaucer seems to conceive
it as one every third year. The usual account is seven youths and seven
maidens either every year or once in nine years.

5302. _many on._ Perhaps we should read ‘manye on’ with S and F, as
vii. 2191, ‘manye an other.’

5319. This expression occurs also in ll. 5598 and 7553.

5360. _fawht._ Elsewhere this verb has preterite ‘foghte,’ as iii.
2651, iv. 2095, but the strong form ‘faught’ is used by Chaucer, e. g.
_Cant. Tales_, B 3519, and this in fact is the originally correct form.

5413. _Chyo._ Ovid says ‘Dia,’ that is Naxos.

5507. _His rihte name_: cp. _Mirour_, 409, ‘par son droit noun Je l’oi
nommer Temptacioun,’ 4243, ‘Si ot a noun par droit nommant,’ &c. and
other similar expressions.

5510. _as men telleth_: cp. l. 6045, ‘men seith.’

5511. According to the margin Extortion is the _mother_ of Ravine.

5550. _femeline_, used repeatedly both as adjective and as substantive
in the _Mirour de l’Omme_.

5551 ff. The tale of Tereus is from Ovid, _Metam._ vi. 424-674, in
some parts abbreviated and in others expanded, with good judgement
usually in both cases, so that this is one of Gower’s best-told
tales. He omits the long account given by Ovid of the way in which
Pandion was persuaded to allow Philomela to accompany Tereus (_Metam._
vi. 447-510), the incidents of the rescue of Philomela from her
imprisonment, which no doubt he felt would be unintelligible to his
readers (587-600), and many of the more shocking details connected with
the death of Itys and the feast upon his flesh. On the other hand he
has added the prayer and reflections of Philomene in her prison (ll.
5734-5768), the prayers of the two sisters (5817-5860), the words of
Progne to Tereus (5915-5927), and especially the reflections on the
nightingale and the swallow at the end of the story (5943-6029). This
latter part is quite characteristic of our author, and as usual it is
prettily conceived.

Chaucer, who tells the story in the _Legend of Good Women_, 2228-2393,
was weary of it even from the beginning (2257 f.), and omits the
conclusion altogether, either as too shocking or as not suiting with
his design. So far as he goes, however, he follows Ovid more closely
than Gower.

5555. See note on Prol. 460.

5598. So also ll. 5319, 7553.

5623. Ovid’s comparison is to fire catching dry straw and leaves,
_Metam._ vi. 456 f.

5643 ff. Ovid compares her state after the deed was done to that of a
lamb hurt by a wolf and still trembling, or a dove which has escaped
wounded from a bird of prey (527-530). Here, on the other hand, the
idea is of being held fast, so that she cannot move or escape; while
Chaucer, using the same similes as Ovid, applies the comparison less
appropriately to her fear of the violence yet to come.

5651. Cp. _Metam._ vi. 531, ‘Mox ubi mens rediit.’

5663 ff.

                        ‘si copia detur,
  In populos veniam; si silvis clausa tenebor,
  Implebo silvas, et conscia saxa movebo.’ _Metam._ vi. 545 ff.

5670. I suspect the combination ‘tale and ende’ may have arisen from
some such phrase as ‘to sette tale on ende’ (or ‘an ende’), meaning to
begin a speech: see _New Engl. Dict._ under ‘ende.’

5676. _where is thi fere?_ that is, ‘where is thy fear of the gods?’
We must not take ‘fere’ in the sense of ‘companion’ or ‘equal,’ because
in that case it could not properly rhyme with ‘Ere.’

5690 f.

          ‘comprensam forcipe linguam
  Abstulit ense fero.’ _Metam._ vi. 556 f.

Gower must be commended for omitting the tasteless lines which
follow in Ovid about the severed tongue, and still more the shocking
statement, which even Ovid accompanies with ‘vix ausim credere,’ of 561
f.

5709. _tyh_, preterite of ‘ten,’ from OE. ‘_tēon_,’ meaning ‘draw,’ and
hence ‘come.’

5724. The punctuation follows F, ‘To hire’ meaning ‘in her case,’ cp.
l. 4182, vii. 4937. It would suit the sense better perhaps to set the
comma after ‘forsake,’ and to take ‘To hire’ with what follows: cp.
note on l. 3966, where it is shown that the punctuation of F is often
wrong in such cases as this.

5726. _hir Sostres mynde_, ‘her sister’s memory.’

5730. _guile under the gore_, that is, deceit concealed, as it were,
under a cloak: cp. l. 6680. The expression ‘under gore’ is common
enough, meaning the same as ‘under wede,’ and this alliterative form
looks like a proverbial expression.

5734-5768. All this is original.

5737. _so grete a wo_: cp. l. 6452, and see Introduction, p. cx.

5778. ‘nec scit quid tradat in illis,’ _Metam._ vi. 580.

5793. ‘Non est lacrimis hic, inquit, agendum, Sed ferro,’ _Metam._ vi.
611.

5802 ff. According to Ovid this was done under cover of a Bacchic
festival (587 ff.).

5816-5860. This is all original.

5840. _to lytel of me let_: see note on l. 1004.

5891 ff. Gower does well in omitting the circumstances of this which
Ovid gives (619-646), and in partially covering the horror of it by
the excuse of madness, but there is one touch which ought to have been
brought in, ‘Ah, quam Es similis patri!’ (621).

5910 ff. Ovid says that Philomela threw the gory head into the father’s
face, and that Tereus endeavoured to vomit up that which he had eaten.
Our author has shown good taste in not following him.

5915 ff. This speech is not in Ovid.

5943-6029. Nearly all this is Gower’s own. Ovid only says, ‘Quarum
petit altera silvas: Altera tecta subit’ (668 f.). We have already
observed upon our author’s tendency to make additions of this
symbolical kind to the stories which he takes from Ovid: see note on i.
2355.

6020. The reading ‘here’ is given both by S and F, but ‘hire’ (‘hir’),
supported by AJMXGCB₂, BT, W, seems to be required by the sense. She
informs them of the falseness of her husband, that they also may learn
to beware of them, that is of husbands. The combination of ‘here’ with
the singular ‘housebonde,’ meaning ‘their husbands,’ would be very
harsh.

6041 ff.

  ‘Ille dolore suo, poenaeque cupidine velox,
  Vertitur in volucrem, cui stant in vertice cristae,
  Prominet immodicum pro longa cuspide rostrum.
  Nomen Epops volucri, facies armata videtur.’

                                                  _Metam._ vi. 671 ff.

The lapwing is identified with the hoopoe because of its crest. In the
_Traitié_, xii, where this story is shortly told, Tereus is changed
into a ‘hupe,’

  ‘Dont dieus lui ad en hupe transformée,
  En signe qu’il fuist fals et avoltier,’

while at the same time in the _Mirour_, 8869 ff., the ‘hupe’ is
represented as the bird which tries to deceive those who search for its
nest, a description which obviously belongs to the lapwing.

6047. Cp. Chaucer, _Parl. of Foules_, 347, ‘The false lapwyng ful of
trecherye.’

6053. _goddes forebode_: cp. Chaucer, _Leg. of Good Women_, 10,

  ‘But goddes forbode but men schulde leve,’

where the second form of text has

  ‘But god forbede but men shulde leve.’

We must take ‘forebode’ as a substantive.

6073. _auht_: modified to suit the rhyme: so ‘awht,’ i. 2770, and
‘naght,’ l. 3786, rhyming with ‘straght.’ The regular forms for Gower
are ‘oght,’ ‘noght.’

6145 ff. This is from Ovid, _Metam._ ii. 569-588. Gower has judiciously
kept it apart from the story of Coronis and the raven, told by him in
the second book, with which it is combined in rather a confusing manner
by Ovid. The story is somewhat expanded by Gower.

6150. _wif to Marte_: cp. 1214 f.

6169. _And caste_: cp. l. 4590, and see note on i. 1895.

6197. ‘mota est pro virgine virgo, Auxiliumque tulit,’ _Metam._ ii. 579
f., but Ovid says nothing of any special prayer to Pallas for help,
nor does he represent that Cornix was before in attendance upon that
goddess.

6207 ff. This is original and characteristic of our author.

6225 ff. This story is from Ovid, _Metam._ ii. 409-507, but Gower
evidently knew it from other sources also, for the name Calistona (or
Callisto) is not given by Ovid, who calls her ‘virgo Nonacrina’ and
‘Parrhasis.’ Hyginus tells it in various forms, _Fab._ 177 and _Poet.
Astr._ ii. 2.

6255. According to Ovid, Diana was quite ignorant of the fact, though
the nymphs suspected it.

6258. _in a ragerie_, that is ‘in sport’: cp. Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_,
E 1847, and the use of the verb ‘rage,’ e. g. i. 1764 and _Cant.
Tales_, A 257, 3273, 3958.

6275 ff. ‘I procul hinc, dixit, nec sacros pollue fontes,’ _Metam._ ii.
464.

6281. F has a stop after ‘schame.’

6291 ff. This address is mostly original: cp. _Metam._ ii. 471 ff.

6334 ff.

  ‘Arcuit omnipotens, pariterque ipsosque nefasque
  Sustulit, et celeri raptos per inania vento
  Imposuit caelo vicinaque sidera fecit.’

                                                  _Metam._ ii. 505 ff.

_Latin Verses_, x. The idea expressed is that though examples of
virginity can only be produced through marriage, yet virginity is
nobler than marriage, as the flower of a rose is nobler than the stock
from which it springs. Marriage, in fact, replenishes the earth, but
virginity heaven: cp. _Trait._ ii.

6359 ff. Cp. _Mirour_, 17119 ff., where the saying is attributed to
Jerome, who says in fact that precedence was given in the streets to
the Vestal Virgins by the highest magistrates, and even by victors
riding in the triumphal car (_adv. Jovin._ ii. 41).

6372 ff. Cp. _Mirour_, 18301 ff. The anecdote is taken from Valerius
Maximus, _Mem._ iv. 5, but the name in the original is ‘Spurina,’ and
he does not thrust out his eyes, but merely destroys the beauty of his
face. In the _Mirour_ it is ‘Coupa ses membres.’

6385 ff. ‘So may I prove that, if a man will weigh the virtues, he will
find that virginity is to be praised above all others.’ The sentence is
disordered for the sake of the rhymes: cp. ii. 709 ff.

6389. The quotation from the Apocalypse is given in the margin of SΔ
and in _Mirour_, 17053 ff. The reference is to Rev. xiv. 4.

6395* ff. Cp. _Mirour_, 17067 and note.

6398 ff. This also appears in _Mirour_, 17089 ff., and _Traitié_, xvi.
It may have been taken from the _Epistola Valerii ad Rufinum_.

6402. The margin makes him ‘octogenarius,’ and so it is also in the
_Mirour_ and _Traitié_, as well as in the _Epistola Valerii_.

6435 ff. This shows more knowledge than could have been got from the
_Roman de Troie_. The story is told by Hyginus, _Fab._ 121, but not
exactly as we have it here. This ‘Criseide douhter of Crisis’ should be
distinguished from the Criseide daughter of Calchas (Briseïda in the
_Roman de Troie_), who is associated with Troilus, if it is worth while
making distinctions where so much confusion prevails.

6442. _dangerous_, that is, ‘grudging’ or ‘reluctant’: cp. Chaucer,
_Cant. Tales_, D 1090, and see note on i. 2443.

6452. _So grete a lust_: cp. l. 5737 and Introduction, p. cx.

6498. _as a Pocok doth._ It is difficult to see the appropriateness
of the comparison, for to ‘stalke’ is to go cautiously or secretly,
and that is evidently the meaning here, so that any idea of display is
out of the question. The peacock was supposed to be ashamed of its
ugly feet, cp. _Mirour_, 23459, and in the _Secretum Secretorum_ we
actually have the expression ‘humilis et obediens ut pavo,’ translated
by Lydgate (or Burgh) ‘Meeke as a pecock.’ Albertus Magnus says, ‘Cum
aspicitur ad solem, decorem ostentat, et alio tempore occultat quantum
poterit’ (_De Animalibus_, 23). There seems to have been a notion that
it was liable to have its pride humbled and to slink away ashamed.

6526. _bile under the winge_, that is, concealed, as a bird’s head
under its wing: apparently proverbial.

6541. _I mai remene ... mene._ This is apparently the reading of the
MSS. The meaning of ‘remene’ is properly to bring back. It is used
earlier, i. 279, with reference to the application of the teaching
about vices generally to the case of love, and here it seems to have
much the same sense. ‘So that I may apply what has been said about this
craft directly’ (‘Withouten help of eny mene’) to the case of lovers,
they being very evidently offenders in this way.

6581. _hire it is_: but in l. 4470, ‘It schal ben hires.’

6608 ff. For the construction see note on i. 718.

6620. _Danger_: see note on i. 2443.

6634. _slyke_: cp. l. 7092*, ‘He can so wel hise wordes slyke.’ The
word means properly to smoothe, hence to flatter: cp. the modern
‘sleek.’

6635. _Be him_, &c., i. e. by his own resources or by the help of any
other.

6636. _To whom_: see note on i. 771.

6654. _a nyht_, i. e. by night, also written ‘anyht,’ ii. 2857.

6672. _Protheüs_, that is Proteus: cp. note on l. 3082.

6674. _in what liknesse_, ‘into any form whatsoever.’

6680. _under the palle_, ‘in secret,’ like ‘under the gore,’ l. 5730.

6713 ff. From Ovid, _Metam._ iv. 192-255, but with several changes. In
the original story the Sun-god came to Leucothoe by night and in the
form of her mother. Clytie (not Clymene) discovered the fact (without
the aid of Venus) and told it to the father; and it was an incense
plant which grew from the place where Leucothoe was buried.

6757. For the expression cp. iii. 2555, ‘Achastus, which with Venus was
Hire priest.’

6779. This change into a flower which follows the sun is suggested by
_Metam._ iv. 266 ff., where we are told that Clytie was changed into a
heliotrope. Here it is a sun-flower apparently.

6807 ff. From Ovid, _Fasti_, ii. 305-358. The ‘mistress’ of whom Ovid
speaks is Omphale, but Gower supposed it to be Iole. He gets ‘Thophis’
as the name of the cave from a misunderstanding of l. 317, and
apparently he read ‘Saba’ for ‘Lyda’ in l. 356, out of which he has got
his idea of a goddess Saba with attendant nymphs. This feature, though
based on a mistake, is a decided improvement of the story, which is
told by Gower in a spirited and humorous manner.

6848 ff. The reading of X in this passage is also that of GOAd₂.

6899. The punctuation is that of F.

6932. _al a route_: so iv. 2145, cp. l. 6257, ‘al a compainie.’

7013. Cp. _Mirour_, 7181 ff.

7048. This is a nautical metaphor, ‘so near the wind will they steer.’
The verb ‘love’ is the modern ‘luff,’ meaning to bring a ship’s head
towards the wind. The substantive ‘lof’ (genit. ‘loves’) means in ME.
a rudder or some similar contrivance for turning the ship, and ‘love’
here seems to mean simply to steer. The rhyme with ‘glove’ makes ‘love’
from ‘lufian’ out of the question, even if it gave a satisfactory sense.

7140. _gon offre._ The ceremony of ‘offering’ after mass was one which
involved a good deal of etiquette as regards precedence and so on, cp.
Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, A 449 ff., and ladies apparently were led up to
the altar on these occasions by their cavaliers.

7179. ‘If I might manage in any other way,’ like the expression ‘(I
cannot) away with,’ &c.

7195 ff. The story comes no doubt from Benoît, _Rom. de Troie_,
2851-4916, where it is told at much greater length. Guido does not
differ much as regards the incidents related by Gower, but by comparing
the two texts in some particular places we can tell without much
difficulty which was Gower’s source. For example, in the speech of
Hector Benoît has,

  ‘Veez Europe que il ont,
  La tierce partie del mont,
  Où sont li meillor chevalier.’ 3791 ff.,

while Guido says, ‘Nostis enim ... totam Affricam et Europam hodie
Grecis esse subiectam, quanta Greci multitudine militum sunt suffulti,’
&c. See below, 7340 ff.

The story is told by Gower with good judgement, and he freely omits
unnecessary details, as those of the mission of Antenor to Greece. The
debate in Priam’s parliament is shortened, and the speeches of Hector
and Paris much improved.

7197 ff. Cp. 3303 ff.

7202. The sentence is broken off and resumed in a different form: see
note on i. 98.

     *       *       *       *       *

7015* ff. Cp. _Mirour_, 7156 ff.

7033*. _And that_, i. e. ‘And provided that.’

7092*. See note on l. 6634.

7105* ff. The tale is told also in the _Mirour de l’Omme_, 7093-7128.
It is to be found in the _Gesta Romanorum_ (which however is not
Gower’s source), and in various other places. Cicero tells what is
practically the same story of Dionysius of Syracuse (_De Nat. Deorum_,
iii. 34), but the acts of sacrilege were committed by him in various
places. The golden mantle was taken from the statue of Zeus at Olympia,
and the beard from that of Aesculapius at Epidaurus, the justification
in this latter case being that Apollo, the father of Aesculapius, was
always represented without a beard. Those who repeated the anecdote in
the Middle Ages naturally missed this point. We may note that Dyonis is
the name given in the _Mirour_.

     *       *       *       *       *

7213 ff. Cp. _Rom. de Troie_, 2779 ff.

7235 ff. _Rom. de Troie_, 3029 ff. Gower has judiciously cut short the
architectural details.

7275. _Esionam_: see note on l. 6719.

7307. _in his yhte_, ‘in his possession.’ For the substance of these
lines cp. _Rom. de Troie_, 2915-2950.

7372. _schape ye_, imperative, for _schapeth_; so ‘Sey ye’ in l. 7435.

7377. _Strong thing_, i. e. a hard thing to bear. This is apparently a
translation of the French ‘fort,’ which was very commonly used in the
sense of ‘difficult’: see the examples in Godefroy’s Dictionary,
e. g. ‘forte chose est de çou croire,’ ‘fors choses est a toi guerroier
ancontre moi.’

7390 ff. ‘Ten men have been seen to deal with a hundred and to have had
the better.’

7400. _Rom. de Troie_, 3842, ‘L’autrier ès kalendes de Mai,’ &c. The
word ‘ender’ is an adjective meaning ‘former,’ originally perhaps an
adverb. It is used only in the expressions ‘ender day’ and ‘ender
night.’ The combination ‘enderday’ occurs in i. 98.

7420. _Rom. de Troie_, 3889 f.,

  ‘Cascune conseilla à mei
  Privéement et en segrei,’ &c.

7451 ff. For Cassandra as the Sibyl cp. Godfrey of Viterbo, _Pantheon_,
p. 214 (ed. 1584).

7497 f.

  ‘Molt est isnele Renommée,
  Savoir fist tost par la contrée,’ &c.

                                             _Rom. de Troie_, 4299 ff.

7555 ff. The further incidents of the embarkation and of the voyage
home, _Rom. de Troie_, 4505-4832, are omitted.

7576 f. Cp. _Rom. de Troie_, 4867 ff.

7591 ff. This incident is related in the _Rom. de Troie_, 17457 ff.
The occasion was an anniversary celebration at the tomb of Hector, and
though the temple of Apollo is not actually named here by Benoît, it
has been previously described at large as Hector’s burial place.

7597 ff. The scene in Chaucer’s _Troilus_, i. 155 ff., is well known.
He took it from Boccaccio.

7612. In the treatment of Avarice Gower has departed entirely from the
plan of fivefold division which he follows in the first three books, as
throughout in the _Mirour_. In the sixth book he deliberately declines
to deal with more than two of the branches of Gule (vi. 12f.), and the
treatment of Lechery is also irregular.

7651. _here tuo debat_, i. e. the strife of those two.

7716. _the Cote for the hod_: that is, he gets a return larger than the
amount that he gave; a different form of the expression from that which
we have in l. 4787.

7719. _hors_: probably plural in both cases.

7724. ‘If a man will go by the safe way.’

7736 ff. This saying is not really quoted from Seneca, but from
Caecilius Balbus, _Nug. Phil._ xi. It must have been in Chaucer’s mind
when he wrote ‘Suffice unto thy good, though it be smal,’ that is,
‘Adapt thy life to thy worldly fortune.’

7830 f. I take this to mean, ‘And suddenly to meet his flowers the
summer appears and is rich.’ For the meaning of ‘hapneth’ see the
examples in the _New English Dictionary_.

7838. _be war_: written as one word in F and afterwards divided by a
stroke.


LIB. VI.

_Latin Verses._ i. 6. _ruit_ seems to be transitive, ‘casts down.’

i. 7. Rather involved in order: ‘on the lips which Bacchus intoxicates
and which are plunged in sleep.’

4. _mystymed_, ‘unhappily produced.’ In other places, as i. 220, iii.
2458, the word seems to mean to order or arrange wrongly. The OE.
‘mistīmian’ means to happen amiss.

7. _dedly_, ‘mortal,’ i. e. subject to death.

34. _wext_, ‘he waxeth’: for the omission of the pronoun see note on i.
1895 and cp. ll. 149, 213, 367, below.

57. For the form of expression cp. i. 380, ii. 2437, and below, l. 106.

59. _sterte_ is for ‘stert,’ pres. tense.

70. _in vers_, that is ‘in order.’ The word ‘vers’ is given in
Godefroy’s Dictionary with the sense ‘state,’ ‘situation’; e. g. _Rom.
de la Rose_, 9523 ff.,

  ‘Malement est changies li vers,
  Or li vient li gieus si divers,
  Qu’el ne puet ne n’ose joer.’

71 f. Cp. _Mirour_, 8246 f.

84. _the jolif wo_: cp. i. 88, vii. 1910, and _Balades_, xii. 4, ‘Si
porte ades le jolif mal sanz cure.’

105. _of such a thew_, ‘by such a habit’ (i. e. of love), to be taken
with ‘dronkelew.’

144. _hovedance_, ‘court dance’: see _New Eng. Dictionary_.

145. _the newefot_: written thus as one word in S and F: it must be
regarded as the name of some dance.

160. _it am noght I_: cp. Chaucer, _Leg. of G. Women_, 314, ‘sir, hit
am I,’ _Cant. Tales_, A 1736, &c.

188. _holde forth the lusti route_: perhaps simply, ‘continue to be
with the merry company.’ See ‘forth’ in the Glossary.

218. _vernage_: the same wine that is called ‘gernache’ or ‘garnache’
in the _Mirour de l’Omme_, ‘vernaccia’ in Italian, but whether a wine
of Italy or Greece seems uncertain.

221. _at myn above_: see note on iv. 914.

239. _the blanche fievere_: cp. Chaucer, _Troilus_, i. 916, with
Skeat’s note.

249. Cp. Chaucer, _Troilus_, i. 420, ‘For hete of cold, for cold of
hete, I dye.’

253. _of such reles_: this seems to men ‘of such strength,’ and
‘relais’ perhaps has a somewhat similar sense in _Mirour_, 3021,

  ‘C’est droit qu’il sente le relais
  De la tempeste et de l’orage.’

As in the modern ‘relay,’ the idea of ceasing or of relaxation may
be accompanied by the notion of fresh vigour taking the place of
exhaustion, and so the word may stand simply for strength or freshness.

If this explanation is not admissible, we must suppose that ‘reles’
means here the power of relaxing or dissolving.

285 f. Cp. _Rom. de la Rose_, 4326 f.,

  ‘C’est la soif qui tous jors est ivre,
  Yvrece qui de soif s’enyvre.’

290. _liste_: perhaps pret. subjunctive; so l. 606, and ‘leste,’ 357.

296. _be the bend_, i. e. ‘by the band,’ at his girdle.

311 f. ‘This for the time alleviates the pain for him who has no other
joy.’ ‘As for the time yit’ means simply ‘for the time,’ cp. ll. 738,
893.

321. For ‘men’ with singular verb cp. ii. 659, v. 5510, 6045, vii.
1352, and Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, A 149, &c.

330 ff. Cp. viii. 2252 ff. and. _Traitié_, xv. 2. The poet referred to
in the margin is perhaps Homer, who is quoted in the _Rom. de la Rose_
as authority for an arrangement somewhat similar to that described here:

  ‘Jupiter en toute saison
  A sor le suel de sa maison,
  Ce dit Omers, deus plains tonneaus;
  Si n’est viex hons ne garçonneaus,
  N’il n’est dame ne damoisele,
  Soit vielle ou jone, laide ou bele,
  Qui vie en ce monde reçoive,
  Qui de ces deus tonneaus ne boive.
  C’est une taverne planière,
  Dont Fortune la tavernière
  Trait aluine et piment en coupes’ &c. 6836 ff. (ed. Méon).

Gower has applied the idea especially to the subject of love, and has
made Cupid the butler instead of Fortune. The basis in Homer is _Il._
xxiv. 527 ff.,

  δοιοὶ γάρ τε πίθοι κατακείαται ἐν Διὸς οὔδει, κ.τ.λ.

360. _trouble_ is properly an adjective, cp. v. 4160. The corrupt
reading ‘chere’ for ‘cler’ has hitherto obscured the sense.

399 ff. This story of Bacchus is told by Hyginus, _Poet. Astr._ ii,
under the heading ‘Aries.’

437. _a riche temple._ This was the temple of Jupiter Ammon.

439. ‘To remind thirsty men’ of the power of prayer.

485 ff. The story is from Ovid, _Metam._ xii. 210 ff.

502 f. _thilke tonne drouh, wherof_, &c., ‘drew such wine for them
that by it,’ &c. See note on i. 771 and cp. ll. 618 and 1249 of this
book.

537. I do not know what authority is referred to.

598. _unteid_, ‘set free,’ so ‘wandering abroad.’

609. The name of this second branch of Gluttony has not been mentioned
before.

632 f. ‘so long as he has wealth by which he may be provided with the
means.’ For the use of ‘founde’ cp. v. 2690 and Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_,
C 537, ‘How gret labour and cost is thee to fynde!’ (addressing the
belly).

640. _for the point of his relief_, ‘in order to please him,’ so below
‘he is noght relieved,’ l. 678.

656. _toke_, subjunctive, ‘how he should take it.’

662. After this line a couplet is inserted by Pauli from the Harleian
MS. 7184 (H₃),

  To take metes and drinkes newe,
  For it shulde alwey eschewe.’

The lines are nonsense and have no metre. They come originally from K,
the copyist of which apparently inserted them out of his own head, to
fill up a space left by the accidental omission of two lines (645 f.)
a little above in the same column. He was making his book correspond
column for column with the copy, and therefore discovered his mistake
when he reached the bottom, but did not care to draw attention to it by
inserting what he had omitted.

663. ‘Physique’ is apparently meant for the Physics of Aristotle, and
something very like this maxim is to be found there, but the quotation,
‘Consuetudo est altera natura,’ is actually taken from the _Secretum
Secretorum_ (ed. 1520, f. 21).

664. The transposition after this line of the passage ll. 665-964,
which occurs in MSS. of the second recension, is not accidental, as we
see by the arrangements made afterwards for fitting in the passage (l.
1146). The object apparently was to lay down the principle ‘Delicie
corporis militant aduersus animam,’ illustrated by the parable of Dives
and Lazarus, before proceeding to the discussion of ‘Delicacie’ in the
case of love, and this is perhaps the more logical arrangement; but the
alteration, as it is made, involves breaking off the discussion here of
the ill effects of change, and resuming it after an interval of nearly
two hundred lines.

674. _Avise hem wel_, i. e. ‘let them take good heed.’

683. ‘Without regard to her honour’: cp. _Balades_, xxii. 4, ‘Salvant
toutdis l’estat de vostre honour.’

709. _abeched_, from the French ‘abechier,’ to feed, used properly
of feeding young birds. The word ‘refreched’ is conformed to it in
spelling.

728. The reading of Pauli, ‘I say I am nought gilteles,’ just reverses
the sense. Berthelette has the text right here.

738. _for a time yit_: cp. 311, ‘As for the time yit,’ and 893, ‘As for
the while yit.’

770. ‘Without wrinkle of any kind,’ cp. _Mirour_, 10164, ‘Car moult
furont de noble grein’; or perhaps ‘Without the smallest wrinkle,’
‘grein’ being taken to stand for the smallest quantity of a thing: cp.
ii. 3310.

778. Cp. Chaucer, _Book of the Duchess_, 939 ff.

785. _schapthe._ For this form, which is given by S and F, cp. the word
‘ssepþe,’ meaning ‘creature’ or ‘form,’ which occurs repeatedly in the
_Ayenbite of Inwyt_.

800. ‘And if it seemed so to all others.’ The person spoken of
throughout this passage as ‘he,’ ‘him,’ is the eye of the lover. This
seems to itself to have sufficient sustenance by merely gazing on the
beloved object, and if it seemed so to all others also, that is, to the
other senses, the eye would never cease to feed upon the sight: but
they, having other needs, compel it to turn away.

809. _as thogh he faste_: the verb seems to be pret. subjunctive, as
‘syhe’ down below.

817. _tireth._ This expresses the action of a falcon pulling at its
prey: cp. Chaucer, _Troilus_, i. 787, ‘Whos stomak foules tiren
everemo.’ The word is used in the same sense also in the _Mirour_, 7731.

845. _mi ladi goode_, ‘my lady’s goodness.’

857. Lombard cooks were celebrated, and there was a kind of pastry
called ‘pain lumbard,’ _Mirour_, 7809.

879. The romance of Ydoine and Amadas is one of those mentioned at
the beginning of the _Cursor Mundi_. It has been published in the
‘Collection des poètes français du moyen âge’ (ed. Hippeau, 1863).
Amadas is the type of the lover who remains faithful through every kind
of trial.

891. _a cherie feste_: cp. Prol. 454. It is an expression used for
pleasures that last but a short time: cp. Audelay’s Poems (Percy Soc.
xiv) p. 22,

  ‘Hit fallus and fadys forth so doth a chere fayre’

(speaking of the glory of this world).

893. Cp. 311, 738.

897. _he_, i. e. my ear.

908. _me lacketh_: the singular form is due perhaps to the use of the
verb impersonally in many cases.

961. _excede_, subjunctive, ‘so as to go beyond reason.’

986 ff. This story furnishes a favourable example of our author’s style
and versification. It is told simply and clearly, and the verse is not
only smooth and easy, but carefully preserved from monotony by the
breaking of the couplet very frequently at the pauses: see 986, 998,
1006, 1010, 1016, &c.

995. We have remarked already upon Gower’s fatalism, iii. 1348, &c.
Here we may refer also to ll. 1026, 1613, 1702, for further indications
of the same tendency.

1059. _is overronne_, that is, ‘has passed beyond.’

1110. _descryve_, apparently ‘understand,’ ‘discern,’ perhaps by that
confusion with ‘descry’ which is noted in the _New Engl. Dictionary_.

1149 f. These two lines are omitted without authority by Pauli.

1176. That is, though they had rendered no services for which they
ought to be so distinguished.

1180. _sojorned_: the word is used in French especially of a horse kept
in stable at rack and manger and refreshed for work: see _Mirour_,
Glossary.

1216. ‘So that that pleasure should not escape him.’

1245. _out of feere_, ‘without fear.’

1262. _unwar_, here ‘unknown’: cp. Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, B 427, ‘The
unwar wo or harm that comth behinde.’

1295. Originally geomancy seems to have been performed, as suggested
in this passage, by marks made in sand or earth, then by casual
dots on paper: see the quotations under ‘geomancy’ in the _New
Engl. Dictionary_. Gower here mentions the four recognized kinds of
divination, by the elements of earth, water, fire, and air.

1306 ff. It is practically certain that Gower was acquainted with the
treatise ascribed to Albertus Magnus, called _Speculum Astronomiae_ or
_De libris licitis et illicitis_ (_Alberti Magni Opera_, v. 655 ff.),
since he seems to follow it to a great extent not only here, but also
in his list of early astronomers (vii. 1449 ff.). There are however
some things here which he must have had from other sources; for there
is no mention in the above-mentioned treatise of ‘Spatula,’ ‘Babilla,’
‘Cernes,’ ‘Honorius.’

1312. _comun rote_, that is, apparently, ‘common custom.’ The
word ‘rote’ is used also below, l. 1457, where it appears to mean
‘condition.’ It must be the same as that which appears in the phrase
‘by rote,’ and it is difficult to believe that it can be the French
‘route,’ as is usually said. The rhyme here and in l. 1457, as well
as those in Chaucer (with ‘cote,’ ‘note’), show that the ‘o’ had an
open sound, and this would be almost impossible from French ‘ou.’
The expression ‘par routine’ or ‘par rotine’ is given by Cotgrave as
equivalent to the English ‘by rote,’ but I am not aware of any use of
such an expression in French as early as the fourteenth century. Many
of the examples of the phrase ‘by rote’ seem to have to do with singing
or church services (cp. Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, B 1712, _Piers Plowmans
Crede_, 379), and Du Cange gives a quotation in which ‘rotae’ seems to
mean ‘chants’ or ‘hymns’ (‘rota,’ 6). From such a sense as this the
idea of a regular order of service, and thence of ‘custom,’ ‘habit,’
might without much difficulty arise.

1314 ff. The following passage from the _Spec. Astronomiae_, cap. 10,
gives most of the names and terms which occur in these lines: ‘Ex
libris vero Toz Graeci est liber de stationibus ad cultum Veneris,
qui sic incipit: _Commemoratio historiarum_ ... Ex libris autem
Salomonis est liber de quatuor anulis, quem intitulat nominibus quatuor
discipulorum suorum, qui sic incipit: _De arte eutonica et ideica_,
&c. Et liber de nouem candariis.... Et alius paruus de sigillis ad
dæmoniacos, qui sic incipit: _Caput sigilli gendal et tanchil_.’

1316. _Razel._ ‘Est autem unus liber magnus Razielis, qui dicitur
liber institutionum,’ &c. In MS. Ashmole 1730 there is a letter to Dr.
Richard Napier from his nephew at Oxford, speaking of a book of Solomon
in the University Library called _Cephar Raziel_, that is, he explains,
‘Angelus magnus secreti Creatoris,’ of which he proposes to make a
copy, having obtained means of entering the library at forbidden hours.
Again, in MS. Ashmole 1790 there is a description of this book.

1320. ‘cui adiungitur liber Beleni de horarum opere,’ _Spec. Astron._
p. 661. The seal of Ghenbal is the ‘sigillum gendal,’ mentioned in the
former citation.

1321 f. _thymage Of Thebith._ Thebith (or Thebit) stands for Thabet
son of Corah, a distinguished Arabian mathematician, to whom were
attributed certain works on astrology and magic that were current in
Latin. Thus we find _Thebit de imaginibus_ very commonly in MSS., and
a _Liber Thebit ben Corat de tribus imaginibus magicis_ was printed in
1559 at Frankfort. In this latter book the author says, ‘Exercentur
quoque hae imagines in amore vel odio, si fuerit actor earum prouidus
et sapiens in motibus coeli ad hoc utilibus.’ Thebith is mentioned
several times in the _Spec. Astronomiae_, e. g. p. 662, ‘Super istis
imaginibus reperitur unus liber Thebith eben Chorath,’ &c. We must take
‘therupon’ in l. 1321 to mean ‘moreover,’ for it is not to be supposed
that the image of Thebith was upon the seal of Ghenbal.

1338. The ‘Naturiens’ are those who pursue the methods of astrology, as
opposed to those who practise necromancy (‘nigromance’) or black magic.

1356. _He bede nevere_: see note on v. 4455.

1359. _red_, originally written ‘rede’ in F, but the final letter was
afterwards erased. See Introduction, p. cxiv.

1371 f. The rhyme requires that ‘become,’ ‘overcome’ shall either be
both present or both preterite (subjunctive), and ‘wonne’ seems to
decide the matter for preterite. The only difficulty is ‘have I’ for
‘hadde I’ in l. 1370, the latter being required also by the sense (for
the reference is to the former time of youth), but not given by the
MSS. ‘So that I wonne’ means ‘Provided that I won.’

1391 ff. This story is from the _Roman de Troie_, 28571-28666,
29629-30092. Guido does not differ as to the main points, but there
are several details given by Gower from Benoît which are not found in
Guido. In particular the ensign carried by Telegonus is mentioned by
Guido only in telling of the dream of Ulysses. Some of the passages
which tend to show that Benoît was our author’s authority are noted
below.

1408. _al the strengthe of herbes_: a poem _De Viribus Herbarum_ passed
in the Middle Ages under the name of Macer.

1422. The mention of ‘nedle and ston’ in this connexion is a rather
daring anachronism, for which of course Gower is responsible.

1424. _Cilly._ Benoît says ‘les isles d’Oloi,’ and Guido ‘in Eolidem
insulam,’ but Sicily has been mentioned shortly before.

1438 f. Cp. _Rom. de Troie_, 28594 ff. Guido does not mention it.

1441. ‘S’el sot des arz, il en sot plus,’ _Rom. de Troie_, 28641.

1445 ff. Benoît says nothing of this, but the story of the adventures
of Ulysses was to some extent matter of common knowledge in the Middle
Ages. Gower may have had it from Ovid, _Metam._ xiv. 277 ff. Guido says
in a general way that Circe was in the habit of transforming those who
resisted her power into beasts.

1457. _into such a rote_, that is, ‘into such a habit’ (or
‘condition’): see note on l. 1312.

1467. _toswolle bothe sides_, ‘with both her sides swollen’: cp. _Rom.
de Troie_, 28660 f.,

  ‘Et si li lesse les costez
  Toz pleins, ço quit, de vif enfant.’

1474. _understode_: subj., see note on Prol. 460.

1481. _on of al the beste_, see note on iv. 2606.

1513 f. _margin._ This quotation is not from Horace, but from Ovid,
_Pont._ iv. 3. 35. Cp. _Mirour_, 10948, where the same quotation occurs
and is attributed as here to ‘Orace.’

1524. The form ‘stature’ is required by the metre here, and is given
by the best MSS. of the second and third recensions. In Prol. 891,
where ‘statue’ occurs, it is reduced to a monosyllable by elision, and
so it is in Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, A 975, 1955. The forms ‘statura,’
‘stature,’ are found with this sense in the Latin and French of the
time.

1541 ff.

  ‘Et si me disoit: Hulixes
  Saiches, ceste conjuncions,
  Cist voloir, ceste asembloisons,
  Que de moi et de toi desirres,
  Ce sunt dolors et mortex ires.’

                                            _Rom. de Troie_, 29670 ff.

The prediction, however, that one of the two would have his death by
reason of their meeting comes later, 29699, whereas Guido combines the
materials here much in the same way as Gower.

1552 ff. This idea of a pennon embroidered with a device is Gower’s own
conception, constructed from the not very clear or satisfactory account
of the matter given by his authority here and later, 29819 ff. The fact
is that Benoît did not understand the expression used in the Latin book
(the so-called ‘Dictys Cretensis’) which he was here following, the
passage being probably corrupt in his copy, and consequently failed to
make it intelligible to his readers. The original statement (made with
reference to the ensign carried afterwards by Telegonus) is, ‘Ithacam
venit gerens manibus quoddam hastile, cui summitas marinae turturis
osse armabatur, scilicet insigne insulae eius in qua genitus erat.’ The
meaning apparently is that his spearhead was made of a sea-turtle’s
shell. Benoît, in recounting the vision, says that the figure which
appeared bore upon the steel head of his lance a crown worked of the
bone of a sea-fish,

  ‘Portoit une coronne ovrée
  D’os de poisson de mer salée.’ 29687 f.

Then afterwards, in telling of the departure of Telegonus to seek his
father, he says that, to show of what country he was, he bore on the
top of his lance the sign of a sea-fish worked like a tower,

  ‘En semblance de tor ovrée.’ 29822.

Guido apparently was not able to make much of this, and after saying,
in the account of the dream, that at the top of the lance there
appeared ‘quedam turricula tota ex piscibus artificiose composita’
(Bodl. MS. Laud 645, with variants ‘craticula,’ MS. Add. 365,
‘curricula,’ printed editions), he subsequently omitted mention of the
recognisance.

1561 f. _A signe it is ... Of an Empire._ Benoît has,

  ‘Que c’iert d’ampire conoissance
  Et si aperte demostrance
  Que por ce seroient devis,’ &c. 29695 ff.,

which may perhaps mean, ‘that it was the cognisance of a kingdom and a
sign that they should be divided.’ In Guido, however, it is ‘hoc est
signum impie disiunccionis’ (MS. Laud 645 and printed text), or ‘hoc
est signum impii et disiunccionis’ (MS. Add. 365).

1567 f. Cp. 2296 ff.

1603 ff. For the order of the clauses here cp. ii. 709, iv. 3520 ff.

1622 ff. _That_, for ‘Til that’; cp. iv. 3273, v. 3422.

1636. ‘And he made himself ready forthwith.’ For the omission of the
pronoun even where the subject is changed cp. v. 3291, 4590.

1637 ff. Cp. _Rom. de Troie_, 29824 ff. Guido says nothing about it.

1643. That is, ‘to avoid espial and wrong suspicions.’

1656. _Rom. de Troie_, 29801 f.,

  ‘A Hulyxes, qui fut ses druz,
  Mande par lui v. c. saluz.’

Guido says nothing about this.

1660. _Nachaie_, a mistake for ‘Acaie,’

  ‘Tant qu’il vint droit en Acaie’;

and this again seems to be from ‘Ithaca.’

1685. _and welnyh ded_: cp. _Rom. de Troie_, 29906 f. Guido says only
‘et ab illis est grauiter vulneratus.’

1689. Gower has judiciously reduced the number from fifteen (_Rom. de
Troie_, 29902).

1696. _for wroth_, that is, ‘by reason that he was wroth’: see note on
iv. 1330. We can hardly take ‘wroth’ as a substantive.

1701. ‘Se il ne fust un poi guenchiz,’ _Rom. de Troie_, 29939.

1707. _With al the signe_, ‘together with the signe,’ like the French
‘ove tout’; cp. _Mirour_ 4 (note).

1745 f. _Rom. de Troie_, 30022 ff. Guido omits this.

1769 ff. For this repetition cp. 2095 ff.

1785. The ‘Cronique imperial’ is evidently the story itself, and not
any particular book in which it is to be found.

1789 ff. The authority which is mainly followed by our author for this
story is the Anglo-Norman _Roman de toute Chevalerie_, by Eustace (or
Thomas) of Kent. The beginning of this, including all that we have to
do with here, has been printed by M. Paul Meyer in his book on the
Alexander romances, ‘Bibliothèque française du moyen âge’ vol. iv. pp.
195-216. Gower was acquainted, however, also with the Latin _Historia
Alexandri de Preliis_, and has made use of this in certain places, as
(1) in the account of Philip’s vision (2129-2170) where he probably
found the French unintelligible, and (2) in the story of the death of
Nectanabus (2289 ff.), of which the Latin authority certainly gives the
more satisfactory account.

The following are some of the points in which Gower agrees with the
_Roman de toute Chevalerie_ against the two Latin versions of the
story, viz. the _Historia de Preliis_ and the _Res Gestae Alexandri_
of Valerius: (1) the celebration by Olympias of the festival of her
nativity, when she rides out on a white mule and is first seen by
Nectanabus, ll. 1823-1880; (2) the omission of the sealing of the
queen’s womb by Nectanabus, this being introduced only in Philip’s
vision; (3) the question of the queen as to how she shall procure
further interviews with the god, and the answer of Nectanabus, ll.
2109 ff.; (4) the circumstances connected with the egg from which the
serpent was hatched, ll. 2219 ff. The English metrical Romance of
Alexander, printed by Weber, is also taken from the _Roman de toute
Chevalerie_, and consequently the details of it are for the most part
the same as those in Gower. It is certain, however, that Gower does
not follow this. It would be quite contrary to his practice to follow
an English authority, and apart from this there are many small matters
here in which he agrees with the French as against the English, e. g.
the name Nectanabus, which is Neptanabus in the English (Anectanabus
in the _Hist. de Preliis_), the mention of the _nativity_ of Olympias
as the occasion of her festival, ‘Grant feste tint la dame de sa
nativité,’ the use of the word ‘artemage,’ l. 1957, the incident of
the dragon being changed into an eagle, l. 2200; and such points of
correspondence as may seem to suggest a connexion between the two
English writers, as in ll. 1844 f., 2231 f., are also to be found in
the French. The English alliterative Romance of Alexander follows the
_Hist. de Preliis_, and consequently it agrees with Gower in the two
passages which have been referred to above.

1798. The sentence is broken off and finished in a different manner.
See note on i. 98, and cp. vii. 3632.

1811. _Thre yomen_, &c. This is an addition by Gower. According to the
original story Nectanabus was alone, and this would evidently be the
better for his purpose.

1828. _list._ This may be present tense, ‘it pleases.’ Loss of the
final _e_ in the preterite would hardly occur except before a vowel:
see Introduction, p. cxv. The French original lays stress here on the
extravagant desire that women have to display themselves.

1831. _At after_, i. e. ‘After,’ used especially of meals, cp. l. 1181,
and Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, B 1445, F 918 ‘at after diner,’ E 1921 ‘At
after mete,’ F 302, 1219 ‘At after soper,’ for which references, as
for many others elsewhere, I am indebted to Prof. Skeat’s very useful
Glossary.

1844 f. The French has

  ‘E tymbres e tabours ont e leur corns corné,’ 130,

and later

  ‘Plus de mil damoisels ount le jur karolé, 140.

The English version of the second line,

  ‘There was maidenes carolying,’

comes very near to Gower.

1924. _Bot if I sihe_, ‘unless I should see,’ pret. subj.

1943 ff. This promise is not in the French.

1959 ff. The astrological terms in these lines are due to Gower. The
original says that Nectanabus laid the image in a bed with candles
lighted round it, bathed it in the juice of certain herbs, and said his
charms over it.

1997. _such thing ... Wherof_: cp. ll. 502, 2398.

2005 f.

  ‘Nectanabus idunc ses karectes fina.’

2062. _putte him._ We should rather read ‘put him’ with S and F: see
Introduction, p. cxvi. The French romance here grotesquely represents
Nectanabus as making up a disguise for himself with a ram’s head and
a dragon’s tail, which he joins together with wax, ‘e puis dedens se
mist.’ The Latin _Hist. de Preliis_ says simply that he changed himself
into a dragon.

2074 ff. The French has,

  ‘Une pel de moton ouvec les cornes prist,
  Une coroune d’or sur les cornes assist.’

The punctuation after ‘tok’ is that of F, but I suspect that ‘in signe
of his noblesse’ belongs really in sense to 2076 f., and refers rather
to the crown than to the horns, in which case we ought to set a full
stop after ‘bar.’

2113. _seth hire grone_, that is, in child-bed.

2128 ff. The French romance, following Valerius in the main, gives a
rather confused account of Philip’s dream. Gower has turned from it to
the _Historia de Preliis_.

2160. _Amphion._ The name apparently is got from ‘Antifon,’ which
occurs below in connexion with the incident of the pheasant’s egg.

2182. _rampende._ The French has ‘mult fierement rampant.’

2199 ff. The transformation into an eagle is found in Valerius and the
French romance, and not in the _Hist. de Preliis_. It may be noted,
however, that the picturesque description which we have here of the
eagle pruning himself and then shaking his feathers, so that the hall
was moved as by an earthquake, is Gower’s own.

2219 ff. The Latin accounts say that a bird, according to Valerius a
hen, came and laid an egg in Philip’s lap as he sat in his hall. The
_Rom. de toute Chevalerie_ makes the incident take place out in the
fields, and the bird, as here, is a pheasant. The expression used, ‘Un
oef laissat chaïr sur les curs Phelippun,’ seems to mean that the egg
was laid in Philip’s lap. There is nothing about the heat of the sun in
the Latin versions.

2250 ff. These lines refer to the precautions taken by Nectanabus to
secure that the child shall be born precisely at the right astrological
moment: cp. _Rom. de toute Chevalerie_, 401-425. Gower has chosen to
omit the details.

2274. _Calistre_, i. e. Callisthenes, who was reputed to be the author
of the history of Alexander which Valerius translated.

2299 ff. The question of Alexander and the answer of Nectanabus is
given as here in the _Hist. de Preliis_. In Valerius and the French
romance Alexander throws Nectanabus down merely in order to surprise
him, and the suggestion that Nectanabus knew that he should die by the
hands of his son is not made till afterwards.

2368. _Zorastes._ The statement here about the laughter of Zoroaster
at his birth is ultimately derived from Pliny, _Hist. Nat._ vii. 15.
It is repeated by Augustine, with the addition ‘nec ei boni aliquid
monstrosus risus ille portendit. Nam magicarum artium fuisse perhibetur

contra suos inimicos prodesse potuerunt; a Nino quippe rege Assyriorum,

14).

2381. ‘Like wool which is ill spun’: cp. i. 10.

2387. _Phitonesse_, cp. iv. 1937.

2411. _betawht To Aristotle_, ‘delivered over to Aristotle’: ‘betawht’
is the past partic. of ‘beteche,’ which occurs afterwards, vii. 4234,
and in Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, B 2114, ‘Now such a rym the devel I
beteche.’

2418. _Yit for a time_: to be taken as one phrase; cp. ‘for a while
yit,’ &c., ll. 311, 738, 893.


LIB. VII.

The account given in the earlier part of this book of the parts of
Philosophy, that is, of the objects of human knowledge, represents in
its essentials the Aristotelian system. The division into ‘Theorique,’
‘Rethorique,’ and ‘Practique’ is in effect the same as Aristotle’s
classification of knowledge as Theoretical, Poetical, and Practical,
and the further division of ‘Theorique’ into Theology, Physics, and
Mathematics, and of ‘Practique’ into Ethics, Economics, and Politics,
is that which is made by Aristotle. The statement of Pauli and others
that this part of Gower’s work is ‘very likely borrowed’ from the
_Secretum Secretorum_ is absolutely unfounded. This treatise is not
in any sense an exposition of the Aristotelian philosophy, indeed
it is largely made up of rules for diet and regimen with medical
prescriptions. Gower is indebted to it only in a slight degree, and
principally in two places, vii. 2014-2057, the discussion of Liberality
in a king, and 3207*-3360*, the tale of the Jew and the Pagan.

The most important authority, however, for the earlier part of the
seventh book has hitherto been overlooked. It is the _Trésor_ of
Brunetto Latini. This book is very largely based upon Aristotle, with
whose works Latini was exceptionally well acquainted, and it is from
this that Gower takes his classification of the sciences, though in
regard to the place of Rhetoric he does not quite agree with Latini,
who brings it in under the head of ‘Politique,’ making Logic the third
main branch of philosophy. Gower takes from the _Trésor_ also many
of his physical and geographical statements and his reference to the
debate on the conspiracy of Catiline. On the other hand his astronomy
is for the most part independent of the _Trésor_, and so also is his
method of dealing with the principles of Government, under the five
points of Policy. Brunetto Latini does not treat of politics generally
so much as of the practical rules to be observed by the Podestà of
an Italian republic. It may be observed that Gower has drawn on the
_Trésor_ also in the sketch of general history given in the Prologue
(ll. 727-820). I refer to pages of the edition of Chabaille, 1863.

26 ff. ‘As to which Aristotle ... declares the “intelligences” under
three heads especially.’ The meaning of ‘intelligences’ here and in l.
176, and of ‘intelligencias’ in the margin, l. 149, seems to be nearly
the same as ‘sciences,’ that is to say, divisions or provinces of
knowledge.

155. _Algorisme._ This stands properly for the decimal system of
numeration, but the use of the word in the plural, l. 158, shows that
Gower did not use it in this sense only. The association of the word
‘Algorismes’ below with the letters _a_, _b_, _c_ (‘Abece’) seems to
suggest some kind of algebraical expression, but this is perhaps due
to a misunderstanding by Gower of the word ‘abaque’ (or ‘abake’) in
the _Trésor_, p. 6: ‘Et de ce sont li enseignement de l’abaque et de
l’augorisme.’

183 ff. ‘Ce est la science par laquele li vii sage s’esforcierent par
soutillece de geometrie de trover la grandeur dou ciel et de la terre,
et la hautesce entre l’un et l’autre.’ _Trésor_, pp. 6, 7.

207 ff. Cp. _Trésor_, p. 15, ‘Cele matiere de quoi ces choses furent
formées les desvance de naissance, non mie de tens, autressi comme li
sons est devant le chant, ... et neporquant andui sont ensemble.’ Cp.
pp. 104, 105.

216. _Ylem_, this is ‘hyle’ (Gr. ὕλη), the Aristotelian term for
matter. For what follows cp. _Trésor_, p. 105.

245. This comparison of the movement of water within the earth to the
circulation of blood in the veins, is taken from the _Trésor_, p. 115:
‘autressi comme li sangs de l’ome qui s’espant par ses vaines, si que
il encherche tout le cors amont et aval.’

256 ff. Cp. _Trésor_, p. 117.

265 ff. This which follows about the Air seems to be partly independent
of the _Trésor_, and the word ‘periferie’ is not there used. Aristotle
divides the atmosphere into two regions only, that of ἀτμίς or moist
vapour, corresponding to the first and second periferies here, and
that of exhalation (ἀναθυμίασις) or fiery vapour, corresponding to the
third, _Meteor._ i. 3.

283 f. ‘According to the condition under which they take their form.’
I suppose the word ‘intersticion’ to be taken from ‘interstitium,’ as
used with a technical sense in astrology. Albumasar, for example, says,
‘Quicquid in hoc mundo nascitur et occidit ex quatuor elementis est
compositum, tribus interstitiis educatum, scilicet principio, medio et
fine, quae tria in illa quatuor ducta duodecim producunt.’ This is the
cause, he says, why there are twelve signs of the zodiac, ‘Praesunt
siquidem haec signa quatuor elementis eorumque tribus interstitiis.’
He then explains that the first ‘interstitium’ of each element is that
condition of it which is favourable to production, growth and vigour,
the second that which is stationary, and the third that which tends
to decay and corruption, so that the word is almost equivalent to
condition or quality. (Vincent of Beauvais, _Spec. Nat._ xv. 36.)

302. Cp. _Trésor_, p. 119, ‘mais li fors deboutemenz dou vent la
destraint et chace si roidement que ele fent et passe les nues et fait
toner et espartir.’

307 ff. Cp. _Trésor_, p. 120.

323 ff. _Trésor_, p. 120, ‘dont aucunes gens cuident que ce soit li
dragons ou que ce soit une estele qui chiet.’ What follows about
‘exhalations’ is not from the _Trésor_.

334. _Assub._ This word is used in Latin translations of Aristotle as
an equivalent of ‘stella cadens.’

339. _exalacion._ This stands for fiery vapour only, originally a
translation of Aristotle’s ἀναθυμίασις.

351 ff. The names ‘Eges’ and ‘Daaly’ (l. 361), must be taken originally
from Aristotle’s expression δαλοὶ καὶ αἶγες, which he says are names
given by some people to various forms of fire in the sky, _Meteor._
i. 4. Our author simply repeated the terms after his authorities and
without understanding them. In fact, ‘Eges’ stands for the same as the
‘Capra saliens’ of the preceding lines.

389. The idea of the four complexions of man, corresponding to the
four elements, is not due to Aristotle, but we find it in the _Trésor_.
The application to matters of love in ll. 393-440 is presumably Gower’s
own.

405 f. Aristotle says on the contrary, οἱ μελαγχολικοὶ οἱ πλεῖστοι
λάγνοι εἰσίν, _Probl._ 30.

437. _To thenke._ For this use of ‘may’ with the gerund cp. ii. 510, ‘I
myhte noght To soffre.’

510. ‘While the flesh has power to act,’ that is during the life of the
body.

521 ff. For the geography which follows cp. _Trésor_, pp. 151-153.

534. _the hevene cope_: cp. l. 1579, ‘under the coupe of hevene,’ where
the spelling suggests the Latin ‘cupa,’ rather than ‘capa,’ as the
origin of the word in this common phrase. The quality of the ‘o’ in
Europe is perhaps doubtful.

536. _Begripeth_: used here as plural, cp. l. 1107: ‘calleth’ in l. 561
with ‘men’ (indef.) as the subject is not a case of the same kind.

545. _who that rede_: subj., cp. Prol. 460.

559. That is, presumably, double as much as either of the other two:
cp. _Trésor_, p. 152, ‘car Asie tient bien l’une moitié de toute la
terre.’

566. _Canahim_: a mistake for ‘Tanaim’ (or ‘Tanain’), see _Trésor_,
p. 152, where the extent of Asia is said to be from the mouths of the
Nile and the ‘Tanain’ (i. e. the Don) as far as the Ocean and the
terrestrial Paradise.

593 ff. Cp. _Trésor_, p. 115.

597. Latini says that this is the explanation given by some people of
the tides, but he adds that the astronomers do not agree with them
(_Trésor_, p. 172).

611. Aristotle does in fact make of αἰθήρ a fifth element, of which the
heaven and the heavenly bodies consist, but Gower takes this account of
it and the name Orbis from the _Trésor_, p. 110, where also we find the
comparison to the shell of an egg.

652 ff. ‘Sapiens dominabitur astris,’ an opinion which is developed in
the _Vox Clamantis_, ii. 217 ff.

694. _Bot thorizonte_, ‘beyond the horizon’: so perhaps in the first
text of v. 3306, ‘But of his lond’ stood for ‘Out of his lond.’
However, this use of ‘but’ is not clearly established in Southern ME.
and perhaps the reading of the second recension, ‘Be thorizonte,’ may
be right. As regards sense, one is much the same as the other: neither
is very intelligible, unless ‘thorizonte’ means the ecliptic.

699. _thei_, that is the planets, not the signs.

725 ff. Cp. _Trésor_, p. 141.

831. _is that on_, i. e. ‘is one,’ or ‘is the first.’

853. The sun’s horses are named by Fulgentius, _Mythol._ ii, in the
same order as we have here, ‘Erythreus, Actæon, Lampos, Philogeus.’
They are said there to represent four divisions of the day, Erythreus,
for example, having his name from the red light of morning, and
Philogeus from the inclination of the sun towards the earth at evening.
Ovid gives a different set of names.

944. ‘In whatever degree he shall exercise his powers.’

978. _as it appendeth_, ‘as it is fitting,’ lit. ‘as it belongs’: cp.
‘appent,’ _Mir._ 1535.

979. _natheles._ This word is frequently used by Gower with no sense of
opposition, meaning ‘moreover’ or something similar: cp. i. 21, vii.
3877, &c.

983. It may be observed that (in spite of this reference and that in l.
1043) our author’s statements about the number and arrangement of stars
in the constellations of the zodiac do not at all correspond with those
in the Almagest.

983 (margin). _produxit ad esse_, ‘brought forth into existence’: the
infinitive is often used as a substantive in Gower’s Latin: e. g. Prol.
_Lat. Verses_, iv. 4, v. 6.

989. _hot and drye._ According to the astrologers, Aries, Leo, and
Sagittarius preside over the element of fire, and are hot and dry by
nature; Taurus, Virgo, Capricornus over that of earth, being dry and
cold; Gemini, Libra, Aquarius preside over air, and are hot and moist;
while Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces are moist and cold, having dominion
over water (Albumasar, cited by Vincent of Beauvais, _Spec. Nat._ xv.
36).

991 f. Aries and Scorpio are the ‘houses’ or ‘mansions’ of Mars, Taurus
and Libra of Venus, Gemini and Virgo of Mercury, Cancer of the Moon,
Leo of the Sun, Sagittarius and Pisces of Jupiter, Capricornus and
Aquarius of Saturn.

1021. _somdiel descordant_: the hot and moist Libra is more in
accordance with her nature: see 1111 ff.

1036 f. This statement and the others like it below, 1073, 1089, 1127,
1147, 1198, 1222, may be taken to indicate that the division of the
signs was very uncertain in our author’s mind. It may be observed that
the usual representation of Taurus in star-maps is with his head, not
his tail, towards Gemini.

1085. _the risinge_: that is to say, Virgo is the ‘exaltation’ of
Mercury, as well as one of his houses.

1100. For the sense of ‘applied’ cp. v. 913.

1115 f. Libra is the exaltation of Saturn.

1135. That is to say, Scorpio is the ‘fall’ of Venus, being the sign
opposite to one of her houses, namely Taurus.

1155 f. Sagittarius is a house of Jupiter, and it is opposite to
Gemini, which is one of the houses of Mercury.

1162. _The Plowed Oxe_, i. e. the ox that has ploughed the land.

1166. Then the swine are killed and the larder, or bacon-tub, comes
into use.

1175. Capricorn is the ‘fall’ of the Moon, being opposite to her house,
Cancer, as the next sign Aquarius is that of the Sun, see l. 1190.

1216. ‘Piscis’ is the reading of the MSS. here in text and margin, but
‘Pisces’ in l. 1253.

1229 ff. That is, Pisces is a house of Jupiter and the exaltation of
Venus.

1239 ff. The reference is apparently to the _Introductorium_ of
Albumasar, but the printed editions of this give an abbreviated text
which does not help us here. A fuller translation of the original may
be found in manuscript, e. g. MS. Digby 194, where something more or
less corresponding to this may be found on f. 55, but the Arabic names
of places make it difficult to follow.

1281 ff. This account of the fifteen stars with their herbs and stones
is taken by Gower from a treatise called ‘Liber Hermetis de xv stellis
et de xv lapidibus et de xv herbis, xv figuris,’ &c., which may be
found in several manuscripts, e. g. MSS. Ashmole 341 (f. 123) and 1471
(f. 120 v^o): cp. l. 1437, where Hermes is mentioned as the authority.
Some information as to the names of the stars here mentioned may be
found in Ideler’s _Untersuchungen über den Ursprung und die Bedeutung
der Sternnamen_, 1809.

1292 ff. ‘Et scias quod stelle fixe habent fortunia et infortunia
quemadmodum et planete’ (_Lib. Herm._).

1317. ‘anabulla seu titimallum.’

1329. _Algol_, or Caput Algol, the Arabic ‘Ras el-ghûl’ (devil’s head),
in Perseus.

1338. _Alhaiot_, probably for ‘Alhaioc,’ that is Capella, from the
Arabic ‘El-‛aijûk.’

1343. ‘prassium seu marrubium.’

1345. _Canis maior_, ‘Alhabor,’ i. e. Sirius.

1356. _Canis minor_, ‘Algomeiza,’ i. e. Procyon.

1362. _Primerole_: in the _Liber Hermetis_ we have here ‘solsecium,
quam elitropiam vocant.’

1364. _Arial_, apparently ‘Cor Leonis,’ i. e. Regulus.

1367. _Gorgonza_: ‘gregonza’ in MS. Ash. 341.

1375. ‘lappacium maius.’

1378. _gret riote_: ‘color huius niger est, faciens hominem iratum,
animosum et audacem et mala cogitantem et maledicentem ... et faciens
fugere demones et congregare.’

1379 ff. ‘Nona stella dicitur Atimet Alaazel, ... et est ex natura
Veneris et Mercurii, et dicitur stella pulchritudinis et racionis,’ &c.
The name ‘Atimet Alaazel’ is from the Arabic ‘El-simâk el-a‛zal,’ that
is the star which we call Spica.

1385. _Salge_, Lat. ‘saluia.’

1387. ‘Decima vero stella Atimet Alrameth, et dicitur saltator, et est
ex natura Martis et Iouis.’ This is the Arabic ‘El-simâk el-râmih,’
which we call Arcturus.

1393. _Venenas_: ‘Vndecima stella dicitur Benenais et est postrema de
ii stellis que sunt in cauda urse maioris.’ In Arabic ‘Banat Na‛sh.’

1401. _Alpheta_, ‘Elfetah,’ from the Arabic ‘El-fak‛ah’ (the beggar’s
dish), meaning the constellation which we call the Northern Crown. Here
the name stands for the principal star of that constellation, Gemma.

1419. _Botercadent._ The Latin says ‘Vultur cadens,’ that is perhaps
Vega; but ‘Botercadent’ would probably be a different star, namely that
called in Arabic ‘Batn-Kaitos’ or Whale’s belly.

1426. _Tail of Scorpio_: in the Latin ‘Cauda Capricorni.’

1449 ff. These names of the chief authors of the science of astronomy
seem to be partly taken from the treatise called _Speculum Astronomiae_
or _De libris licitis et illicitis_, cap. ii. (_Alberti Magni Opera_,
v. 657): cp. note on vi. 1311 ff. The passage is as follows, under
the heading ‘De libris astronomicis antiquorum’: ‘Ex libris ergo qui
post libros geometricos et arithmeticos inueniuntur apud nos scripti
super his, primus tempore compositionis est liber quem edidit Nembroth
gigas ad Iohathonem discipulum suum, qui sic incipit: _Sphaera caeli_
&c., in quo est parum proficui et falsitates nonnullae, sed nihil
est ibi contra fidem quod sciam. Sed quod de hac scientia vtilius
inuenitur, est liber Ptolemaei Pheludensis, qui dicitur Graece Megasti,
Arabice Almagesti, ... quod tamen in eo diligentiae causa dictum est
prolixe, commode restringitur ab Azarchele Hispano, qui dictus est
Albategni in libro suo.... Voluitque Alpetragius corrigere principia et
suppositiones Ptolemaei,’ &c.

It would seem that, either owing to corruption of his text or to
misunderstanding, our author separated the name ‘Megasti’ from its
connexion with Ptolemy and the Almagest, and made of it a book called
‘Megaster,’ which he attributes to Nembrot.

1461. Alfraganus was author of a book called in Latin _Rudimenta
Astronomica_.

1576 f. _out of herre ... entriketh_, that is, ‘involves (this world)
in perplexity, so that it is disordered.’

1579. _coupe of hevene_, see note on l. 534.

1595 ff. The discussion in the Roman Senate on the fate of the
accomplices of Catiline is here taken as a model of rhetorical
treatment. The idea is a happy one, but it is borrowed from the
_Trésor_, where Latini, after laying down the rules of rhetoric,
illustrates them (pp. 505-517) by a report and analysis of the speeches
in this debate, as they are given by Sallust. The ‘Cillenus’ mentioned
below is D. Junius Silanus, who as consul-designate gave his opinion
first. It is tolerably evident in this passage, as it is obvious in
iv. 2647 ff., that Gower did not identify Tullius with Cicero, though
Latini actually says, ‘Marcus Tullius Cicero, cils meismes qui enseigne
l’art de rectorique, estoit adonques consule de Rome.’

1615 ff. Cp. _Trésor_, p. 509, ‘mais Jules Cesar, qui autre chose
pensoit, se torna as covertures et as moz dorez, porce que sa matiere
estoit contraire,’ &c.

1623. _after the lawe._ It may be observed as a matter of fact that the
law was on the side of Caesar, and that this was his chief argument
against the death penalty.

1706. _Fyf pointz._ The _Secretum Secretorum_ recommends to rulers the
virtues of Liberality, Wisdom, Chastity, Mercy, Truth, and afterwards
of Justice, but there is no very systematic arrangement there, nor in
general does the treatment of the subject, except partly as regards
Liberality, resemble Gower’s. It has been already observed that the
treatment of Politics in the _Trésor_ is altogether different from that
which we have here.

1783 ff. This story comes originally from 3 Esdras, ch. iii, iv. The
names, however, of Arpaghes and Manachaz are not found in the text of
that book, and the story of Alcestis, which Zorobabel tells, is of
course a later addition, made no doubt by our author.

1809. ‘Having his mind so disposed.’

1856. _behelde_, an archaic form, used here for the rhyme.

1884 ff. 3 Esdr. iv. 29, ‘Videbam tamen Apemen filiam Bezacis, mirifici
concubinam regis, sedentem iuxta regem ad dexteram,’ &c.

1961 f. ‘He that is true shall never rue,’ or some such jingle. Cp.
Shaksp. _K. John_, v. 7,

            ‘Nought shall make us rue,
  If England to herself do rest but true.’

2000. _laste_, pret. ‘lasted’: cp. Prol. 672, iv. 2315.

2017 ff. This seems to be suggested by a passage in the _Secretum
Secretorum_. ‘Reges sunt quattuor. Rex largus subditis et largus sibi,
Rex auarus subditis et auarus sibi, Rex auarus sibi et largus subditis,
Rex largus sibi et auarus subditis.’ This last is pronounced to be the
worst, as the first is the best.

2031 ff. This refers to a passage in the _Secretum Secretorum_ (ed.
1520, f. 8), which runs thus in the printed edition: ‘Que fuit causa
destructionis regni calculorum: vnde quia superfluitas expensarum
superat redditus ciuitatum, et sic deficientibus redditibus et expensis
reges extenderunt manus suas ad res et redditus aliorum. Subditi ergo
propter iniuriam clamauerunt ad deum excelsum gloriosum, qui immittens
ventum calidum afflixit eos vehementer, et insurrexit populus contra
eos et nomina eorum penitus de terra deleuerunt.’

This is obviously corrupt, and it is evident that ‘calculorum’ stands
for a proper name, which Gower read ‘Caldeorum,’ as it is in MS. Laud
708. Other Bodleian MSS. to which I have referred give ‘Saldeorum’
(Bodley 181), ‘cangulorum’ (Add. C. 12), ‘singulorum ’ (Laud 645),
‘Anglorum’ (Digby 170). ‘Nonne’ is the reading of the MSS. for ‘vnde,’
and it seems that ‘Que fuit’ &c. is also a question.

2039. So in the _Secretum Secretorum_ (shortly before the passage
quoted above), ‘Debes igitur dona dare iuxta posse tuum cum mensura,
hominibus indigentibus atque dignis.’

2050. _of ken_, here apparently ‘of quality.’

2061 ff. The basis of this story is to be found in Seneca, _De
Beneficiis_, v. 24, ‘Causam dicebat apud divum Iulium ex veteranis
quidam,’ &c., but there is no question there of an advocate; the
veteran simply gains his case by recalling his personal services.
The story appears in a form more like that of Gower in the _Gesta
Romanorum_, 87 (ed. Oesterley), but the name Julius is not there
mentioned, only ‘Quidam imperator.’ It may be observed also in general,
that though many stories are common to the _Gesta Romanorum_ and
the _Confessio Amantis_, there is no instance in which Gower can be
proved to have used the _Gesta Romanorum_ as his authority. Indeed the
tales are there so meagrely and badly told for the most part, that
there would be little temptation to turn to it if any other book were
available.

Such references as ‘dicitur in gestis Romanorum’ are not to this book
but to Roman History.

Hoccleve tells this story much as we have it here, in his _Regement of
Princes_, 3270 ff., e. g.

  ‘Han ye forgote how scharp it with yow ferde,
  Whan ye were in the werres of Asie?
  Maffeith, your lif stood there in jupartie;
    And advocat ne sente I non to yow,
  But myself put in prees and for yow faght,’ &c.

2115 ff. This anecdote is perhaps taken from the _Trésor_, where it
occurs more appropriately as an example of hypocritical excuses for
not giving, ‘Li Maistres dit: Après te garde de malicieus engin de
escondire, si comme fist le rois Antigonus, qui dist à un menestrier
qui li demandoit un besant, que il demandoit plus que à lui n’aferoit;
et quant il li demanda un denier, il dist que rois ne devoit pas si
povrement doner. Ci ot malicieus escondit; car il li pooit bien doner
un besant, porce que il estoit rois, ou un denier, porce que il estoit
menestrel. Mais Alixandres le fist mieulx; car quant il dona une cité
à un home, cil li dist que il estoit de trop has afaire à avoir cité;
Alixandres li respondit: Je ne pren pas garde quel chose tu dois avoir,
mais quel chose je doi doner’ (p. 412). This may serve as a rather
favourable example of Latini’s style.

2132. _is in manere_: cp. l. 4344. It seems to mean that the virtue of
giving depends on the measure with which it is done: cp. _Praise of
Peace_, 53.

2139. _To helpe with_: cp. i. 452, 2172, ii. 283, &c.

2194. _holden up his oil_: cp. l. 2584, ‘To bere up oil.’ The only
other instance which I can quote of this expression is from Trevisa’s
translation of the _Polychronicon_ (Rolls’ Series, vol. iii. p. 447, a
reference which I owe to Dr. Murray), ‘There Alisaundre gan to boste
... and a greet deel of hem that were at the feste hilde up the kynges
oyl.’ (In the Latin, magna convivantium parte assentiente.’) In all
these cases it is used of flatterers, and ‘oil’ seems to stand in this
phrase for ‘pride’ or ‘vainglory.’ I am disposed to think it is simply
the French ‘oil,’ meaning ‘eye,’ and getting its present sense from
such Biblical expressions as ‘oculi sublimium deprimentur,’ ‘oculos
superborum humiliabis,’ ‘oculos sublimes, linguam mendacem’; but I can
quote no examples of this meaning in French.

2217 ff. This story is based originally on an anecdote told by Valerius
Maximus: ‘Idem Syracusis, cum holera ei lavanti Aristippus dixisset,
Si Dionysium adulari velles, ista non esses, Immo, inquit, si tu ista
esse velles, non adularere Dionysium’ (_Mem._ iv. 3). It has been
repeated often in a short form.

2268. _the worldes crok_, that is, the crooked way of the world. See
the quotations in the _New Engl. Dictionary_ under ‘crook,’ 12.

2279. _joutes_: see Godefroy’s Dictionary, where an instance is quoted
of the use of this word in a French version of this very story.

2302. F punctuates after ‘pyke,’ and no doubt rightly so. The word
‘trewely’ corresponds to the Latin ‘certe’ in the margin above.

2355 ff. The Roman Triumph as here related was a commonplace of
preachers and moralists, cp. Bromyard, _Summa Praedicantium_, T. v. 36,
‘Triumphus enim secundum Isidorum dicitur a tribus: quia triumphator
Romanus cum victoria versus civitatem veniens tres honores habere
debuit,’ &c. So l. 2366, ‘Of treble honour he was certein.’ It is also
in the _Gesta Romanorum_, 30 (ed. Oesterley), but from neither of these
could Gower have got his ‘Notheos’ (for Γνῶθι σεαυτόν).

2416 ff. This custom is spoken of in Hoccleve’s _Regement of Princes_
with a marginal reference to the _Vita Iohannis Eleemosynarii_, where
it is in fact mentioned (Migne, _Patrol._, vol. 73, p. 354).

2527 ff. From 1 Kings xxii. It will be seen that the story is told
rather freely as regards order of events, as if from memory.

2531 (margin). _organizate_, used in a musical sense.

2553. _Godelie_: the person meant is Athaliah.

2584. _bere up oil_: see note on l. 2194.

2660. _astraied._ See _New Engl. Dict._, under ‘astray,’ _verb_ and
_adv._

2698 (margin). No manuscript here gives the reading ‘regiminis,’ so far
as I know; but it is required by the sense, and the reading ‘regis’
might easily arise from the abbreviation of ‘regiminis,’ as we find it
in some MSS. at l. 3106 (margin). Note that S is defective here, and J,
Ad, K omit the Latin margin. Δ attempts an emendation.

2726 f. _lete Of wrong to don_, i. e. ‘abstain from doing wrong.’

2765 ff. From Godfrey of Viterbo (in _Monum. Germ. Hist._ xxii.
p. 169), ‘Quando voluit rectores dare provinciis ... nomina eorum
examinabat in populo, dicens: Si quis habet crimen contra eos, dicat et
probet,’ &c. This passage is not contained in the earlier redactions
of the _Pantheon_, and consequently we may conclude that Gower’s copy
was one which contained the later additions: cp. notes on 4181 ff. and
viii. 271 ff.

2771. _his name_, that is, his reputation: cp. 2774.

2780. _stod ... upon_, ‘rested upon,’ ‘was guided by.’

2783 ff. The saying by which this story is characterized, ‘malle
locupletibus imperare quam ipsum fieri locupletem,’ is more properly
attributed to M’. Curius Dentatus (Valerius Maximus, _Mem._ iv. 3. 5):
but Fabricius also rejected gifts sent him by the Samnites.

2810. _bothe_: apparently both the men and their possessions.

2833 ff. This is probably Conrad II, of whom Godfrey of Viterbo says
‘nulli violatori pacis parcebat.’

2845 ff. Originally taken from Valerius Maximus, who tells it,
however, with reference to Charondas, the supposed legislator of Thurii
(_Mem._ vi. 5).

2864. _sete_: apparently a strong past participle formed from ‘sette’
by confusion with ‘sitte ‘: cp. ‘upsete’ rhyming with ‘misgete,’ viii.
244.

2883. _of dawe_: equivalent to ‘of this lif,’ iv. 3414.

2889 ff. This is a story which we find very often repeated (originally
from Herodotus), e. g. Valerius Maximus, _Mem._ vi. 3, _Gesta
Romanorum_, 29 (without mention of Cambyses by name), Hoccleve’s
_Regement of Princes_, &c. In Δ we find added to the marginal Latin,

  ‘vnde versus,
  Sede sedens ista iudex inflexibilis sta,
  Sit tibi lucerna lux, lex, pellisque paterna,
  Qua resides natus pro patre sponte datus.
  A manibus reuoces munus, ab aure preces.’

It would seem that the last line should stand as the second.

2902. _Avise him_, ‘Let him consider.’

_flitte_, ‘turn aside,’ cp. iv. 214; but also intransitive, v. 7076.

2917 ff. Another often repeated story. The _Gesta Romanorum_ has it
(169) with a reference to Trogus Pompeius (that is Justin, _Epit._ iii.
3). Gower makes the city Athens instead of Sparta (cp. 3089), and the
god Mercury instead of Apollo.

3054 ff. This list of legislators is from the _Trésor_, p. 24, but the
text which our author used seems to have been corrupt. The passage
runs thus in the printed edition: ‘Moyses fu li premiers qui bailla la
loi as Hebreus; et li rois Foroneus fu li premiers qui la bailla as
Grezois; Mercures as Egypciens, et Solon à cels de Athenes; Ligurgus as
Troyens; Numa Pompilius, qui regna après Romulus en Rome, et puis ses
filz, bailla et fist lois as Romains premierement,’ &c. If we suppose
‘Solon’ to have been omitted in the MS., the passage might read (with
changes of punctuation) nearly as we have it in Gower.

3092. _on the beste Above alle other_: cp. iv. 2606, &c.

3137 ff. Cp. _Mirour de l’Omme_, 13921, and see also ii. 3204 ff.
(margin).

3144. _Troian_: so given in all MSS. for ‘Traian.’ So also in the
_Mirour_, 22168, and in Godfrey of Viterbo, _Spec. Reg._ ii. 14 (_Mon.
Germ. Hist._ xxii. p. 74).

3181 ff. Valerius Maximus, _Mem._ v. 6: but he does not mention the
Dorians as the enemy against whom Codrus fought. However, the story was
a common one: cp. _Gesta Romanorum_, 41.

3201. _lemes_: cp. Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, A 3886.

     *       *       *       *       *

3149* f. The reference is to the Epistle of St. James ii. 13, ‘Iudicium
enim sine misericordia illi qui non fecit misericordiam.’

3157*. That is, ‘Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.’

3161* f. Cp. _Mirour de l’Omme_, 13918 ff., where the same is quoted.

3163* ff. Quoted also in the _Mirour_, 13925 ff.,and there also
attributed to Tullius, but I cannot give the reference.

     *       *       *       *       *

3210. _drawe_: the change to subjunctive marks this sentence as really
conditional.

3215 ff. Valerius Maximus, _Mem._ v. 1. 9.

3217. _in jeupartie_, i. e. equally balanced, the result uncertain.

3267 ff. Justinian II is described by Gibbon as a cruel tyrant, whose
deposition by Leontius was fully deserved, and who, when restored by
the help of Terbelis, took a ferocious vengeance on his opponents:
‘during the six years of his new reign, he considered the axe, the
cord, and the rack as the only instruments of royalty.’ Nothing
apparently could be less appropriate than the epithet ‘pietous,’ which
Gower bestows upon him.

3295 ff. This again was a very common story: cp. _Gesta Romanorum_,
48 (ed. Oesterley). Hoccleve tells it with a reference to Orosius,
_Regement of Princes_, 3004 ff. Gower probably had it from Godfrey of
Viterbo, _Pantheon_, p. 181 (ed. 1584), where Berillus is given for
Perillus, as in our text. He takes ‘Phalaris Siculus’ as the tyrant’s
name, and shortens it to Siculus.

3302. I take the preceding three lines as a parenthesis, and this as
following l. 3298.

3341. ‘Dionys’ is a mistake for Diomede, or rather Diomedes is confused
with the tyrant Dionysius.


3355 ff. Cp. Ovid, _Metam._ i. 221 ff.

3359. _With othre men_, i. e. ‘by other men’: cp. viii. 2553.

3387 ff. This characteristic of the lion is mentioned by Brunetto
Latini, _Trésor_, p. 224.

3417 ff. This story is told much as it appears in Justin, _Epit._ i.
8, and Orosius, _Hist._ ii. 7, but the name Spertachus (Spartachus) is
apparently from Peter Comestor (Migne, _Patrol._. vol. 198, p. 1471),
who gives this as the name of Cyrus in his boyhood. The same authority
may have supplied the name ‘Marsagete,’ for the histories named above
call Thamyris only ‘queen of the Scythians’; but Comestor omits the
details of the story.

     *       *       *       *       *

3207* ff. The tale of the Jew and the Pagan is from the _Secretum
Secretorum_, where it is told as a warning against trusting those who
are not of our faith. The differences are mainly as follows. No names
of places are mentioned in the original; the ‘pagan’ is called ‘magus
orientalis,’ and he rides a mule: the Jew is without provisions, and
the Magian feeds him as well as allowing him to ride: the Jew is
found not dead but thrown from the mule, with a broken leg and other
injuries--there is no mention of a lion except in the entreaties of
the Magian, ‘noli me derelinquere in deserto, ne forte interficiar a
leonibus.’ The Magian is about to leave him to die, but the Jew pleads
that he has acted only in accordance with his own law, and again
appeals to the Magian to show him the mercy which his religion enjoins.
Finally the Magian carries him away and delivers him safely to his own
people. Probably our author thought that this form of the story unduly
sacrificed justice to mercy, and therefore he killed his Jew outright.

3342* ff. Note the subjunctive after ‘who (that)’ here and in ll. 3349,
3355: see note on Prol. 460.

     *       *       *       *       *

3418. The name ‘Spertachus’ is given in full by F in the Latin summary,
l. 3426 (margin). In the English text the first syllable is abbreviated
in most copies, but A has ‘Spartachus’ and H₃ ‘Spertachus.’

3539. _Pite feigned_: cp. l. 3835.

3581. The reference should be to Juvenal, _Sat._ viii. 269 ff.,

  ‘Malo pater tibi sit Thersites, dummodo tu sis
  Aeacidae similis, Vulcaniaque arma capessas,
  Quam te Thersitae similem genuisset Achilles.’

Gower has here taken the point out of the quotation to a great extent,
but it occurs in the _Mirour_, 23371 ff., in its proper form, though
with the same false reference.

3627 ff. From the Book of Judges, ch. vii.

3632. For the anacoluthon cp. iv. 3201, vi. 1798, and note on i. 98.

3639. The reading of the second recension, ‘hem,’ seems clearly to be
right here: ‘against those who would assail them.’

3640 ff. The meaning apparently is that each single division of the
three which the enemy had was twice as large as Gideon’s whole army.
The original text says nothing of the kind.

3752. _per compaignie_, ‘together.’

3820 ff. 1 Samuel xv.

3860 ff. 1 Kings ii.

3877. _natheles_, ‘moreover’: cp. 4242 and note on Prol. 39.

3884. _that_, for ‘to that’: cp. Prol. 122.

3891 ff. 1 Kings iii.

4011. _propre_, i. e. ‘in himself.’

4027 ff. 1 Kings xii.

4144. _can ... mai_, used in their original senses, the one implying
knowledge and the other active power.

4181 ff. The person meant is Antoninus Pius, of whom his biographer
Capitolinus says that he loved peace ‘eousque ut Scipionis sententiam
frequentarit, qua ille dicebat, malle se unum civem servare quam mille
hostes occidere’ (_Hist. August._ ed. 1620, p. 20). Godfrey of Viterbo,
in the text given by Waitz (_Mon. Germ. Hist._ xxii. pp. 75, 163),
regularly calls him Antonius, and probably Gower had the saying from
this source. It is one of the later additions to the _Pantheon_: cp.
note on 2765 ff.

4195. _is due To Pite._ This seems to mean ‘is bound by duty’ to show
mercy.

4228. _His trouthe plight_, ‘the engagement of his faith.’ Here we have
the word ‘plight’ from OE. ‘pliht,’ to be distinguished from ‘plit.’

4242. _natheles_: cp. l. 3877.

4245. _hihe_: note the definite form after the possessive genitive, as
after a possessive pronoun.

4284. ‘And even if it should chance that he obtained any friendliness
from her.’ For the use of ‘compainie’ cp. v. 4558.

4335. _Barbarus_: more properly Arbaces, but ‘Barbatus’ in the
_Pantheon_ (p. 165, ed. 1584).

4361 ff. Cp. Justin, _Epit._ i. 7, where however the expedient is said
to have been used (as related by Herodotus) after Cyrus had put down a
revolt.

4406 ff. Numbers xxv.

4408. _Amalech_: Balak is meant.

4464 ff. This means apparently that the later time of life will be as a
dark night which is not illuminated by any sunshine of dawn; but it is
not very clearly expressed.

4469 ff. 1 Kings xi.

4515. That is, ‘Ahijah the Shilonite,’ called ‘Ahias Silonites’ in the
Latin version.

4559 ff. (margin). The quotation is from the _Secretum Secretorum_:
‘O summe rex, studeas modis omnibus custodire et retinere calorem
naturalem’ (ed. 1520, f. 25 v^{o}).

4574 f. Caracalla, son of Severus, is here meant. His name was Aurelius
Antoninus, and he is called Aurelius Antonius in the _Pantheon_ (_Mon.
Germ. Hist._ xxii. p. 166). Caracalla is called by Orosius ‘omnibus
hominibus libidine intemperantior, qui etiam novercam suam Iuliam
uxorem duxerit’ (_Hist._ vii. 18), and this character of him is
repeated in the _Pantheon_.

4593 ff. This story is from Ovid, _Fasti_, ii. 687-720. Gower’s
rendering of it is remarkable for ease and simplicity of style: see
especially ll. 4667-4685, 4701-4717.

4598. Neither Aruns nor Sextus is mentioned by name in Ovid, who speaks
only of ‘Tarquinius iuvenis.’ Gower gives to Aruns the place of Sextus
throughout this and the following story.

4623. _schette_, intransitive, equivalent to ‘were shut’: cp. iii. 1453.

4701 ff. The sacrifice at which this portent occurred is here brought
into connexion with the capture of Gabii, a construction which is not
unnaturally suggested by Ovid’s abrupt transition, l. 711.

4718 ff.

  ‘Consulitur Phoebus. Sors est ita reddita: Matri
    Qui dederit princeps oscula, victor erit.’ _Fasti_, ii. 713 f.

Ovid means that a message was sent to Delphi; but our author
understands it differently.

4739 f. ‘Creditus offenso procubuisse pede’ (720).

4754 ff. This again is from Ovid, where it occurs as a continuation of
the last story, _Fasti_, 721-852. Chaucer, who tells this story in the
_Legend of G. Women_, 1680 ff., also follows Ovid, and more closely
than Gower, e. g. 1761 ff., 1805 ff., 1830f.

4757. _unskilfully_, that is, ‘unjustly,’ without due ‘skile’ or reason.

4778 ff. ‘Non opus est verbis, credite rebus, ait’ (734).

4805 f. This is derived from a misunderstanding of _Fasti_, ii. 785,

  ‘Accipit aerata iuvenem Collatia porta.’

Cp. l. 4911 below. Both Chaucer and Gower make the tragedy occur at
Rome, though Chaucer professes to have Livy before him.

4902. ‘audentes forsve deusve iuvat.’

4937. _To hire_: cp. v. 5724. It means here much the same as ‘by her.’

5062. _sche myhte it noght_, ‘sche could not help it.’

5088 ff.

    ‘Illa iacens ad verba oculos sine lumine mouit,
      Visaque concussa dicta probare coma.’ _Fasti_, ii. 845 f.

5093 ff. This latter part is added from other sources, perhaps from
Livy.

5131 ff. Chaucer tells the story of Virginia as the Tale of the
Doctor of Physic, professing to follow Livy, but actually taking his
materials chiefly from the _Roman de la Rose_, 5613 ff., from which he
transcribes also the reference to ‘Titus Livius.’ His story differs
from that of Livy in many respects, and the changes are not at all
for the better. For example, Chaucer does not mention the absence of
Virginius in the camp, and he makes him kill his daughter at home and
carry her head to Appius. Gower follows Livy, or some account drawn
from Livy, without material alteration. It may be observed that Chaucer
(following the _Rom. de la Rose_) uses the name ‘Apius’ alone for the
judge, and ‘Claudius’ for the dependent, while Gower names them more
correctly ‘Apius Claudius’ and ‘Marchus Claudius.’ On the subject
generally reference may be made to Rumbaur’s dissertation, _Geschichte
von Appius und Virginia in der engl. Litteratur_, Breslau, 1890.

5136. _Livius Virginius_, a mistake for ‘Lucius Virginius.’

5151. _Ilicius_, that is, Icilius.

5209. _til that he come_, ‘till he should come,’ the verb being pret.
subjunctive.

5254 ff. The sentence is irregular in construction, but intelligible
and vigorous: ‘but as to that command, like the hunted wild boar, who
when he feels the hounds hard upon him, throws them off on both sides
and goes his way, so (we may say) this knight,’ &c. The simile is due
to Gower.

5261. _kepte_, ‘waited for.’

5307 ff. From the Book of Tobit, ch. vi-viii. The moral of the story is
given by vi. 17, where Raphael says to Tobias, ‘Hi namque qui coniugium
ita suscipiunt, ut Deum a se et a sua mente excludant, et suae libidini
ita vacent sicut equus et mulus, quibus non est intellectus, habet
potestatem daemonium super eos.’ This, however, is absent from the
English version (which follows the LXX), as are also the precepts
which follow, about nights to be spent in prayer by the newly married
couple. The same is the case with the five precepts given to Sara by
her parents, which are mentioned in the _Mirour_, 17701 ff.

5390. This line, written in F as follows,

  ‘Hov trewe · hou large · hou ioust · hov chaste,’

is enough to show that _v_ and _u_ are used indifferently in this kind
of position: cp. movþe: couþe, 5285 f.

5408. _Do wey_, ‘Have done’: see _New English Dictionary_, ‘do,’ 52.


LIB. VIII.

We may suppose that our author had some embarrassment as regards the
subject of his eighth book. It should properly have dealt with the
seventh Deadly Sin and its various branches, that is, as the _Mirour de
l’Omme_ gives them, ‘Fornicacioun,’ ‘Stupre,’ ‘Avolterie,’ ‘Incest,’
‘Foldelit.’ Nearly all of these subjects, however, have already been
treated of more or less fully, either in the fifth book, where branches
of Avarice are spoken of with reference to the case of love, or in the
seventh, under the head of Chastity as a point of Policy. Even the
author’s commendation of Virginity, which might well have been reserved
for this place, and which would have been rather less incongruous at
the end than in the middle of the shrift, has already been set forth
in the fifth book. There remained only Incest, and of this unpromising
subject he has made the best he could, first tracing out the gradual
development of the moral (or rather the ecclesiastical) law with regard
to it, and then making it an excuse for the Tale of Apollonius (or
Appolinus) of Tyre, which extends over the larger half of the book. The
last thousand lines or so are occupied with the conclusion of the whole
poem.

36. _upon his grace_, that is, free for him to bestow on whom he would.

44. Raphael is not named in Genesis.

48. _Metodre_, that is, Methodius, in whose _Revelationes_ it is
written, ‘Sciendum namque est, exeuntes Adam et Evam de Paradiso
virgines fuisse,’ so that ‘Into the world’ in l. 53 must mean from
Paradise into the outer world.

62 ff. This is not found in Genesis, only ‘genuitque filios et filias,’
but Methodius says that the sisters of Cain and Abel were Calmana and
Debora.

110. For the hiatus cp. _Mirour_, 12241,

  ‘De Isaäk auci je lis.’

158. _ne yit religion._ The seduction of one who was a professed member
of a religious order was usually accounted to be incest: cp. _Mirour_,
9085 ff. and l. 175 below.

170. ‘I keep no such booth (or stall) at the fair,’ that is, ‘I do no
such trade.’

244. _upsete_: see Introduction, p. cxix, and cp. vii. 2864.

271 ff. Gower tells us here that he finds the story in the _Pantheon_.
That is true, no doubt: it is told there in the peculiar kind of verse
with which Godfrey of Viterbo diversified his chronicle, and a most
useful text of this particular story, showing the differences of three
redactions, is given by S. Singer in his _Apollonius von Tyrus_, Halle,
1895, pp. 153-177. There is ample evidence that Gower was acquainted
with the _Pantheon_, but it is not the case that he followed it in this
story, as has been too readily assumed. Godfrey tells the tale in a
much abbreviated form, and Gower unquestionably followed mainly the
Latin prose narrative which was commonly current, though he thought
the _Pantheon_, as a grave historical authority, more fit to be cited.
The very first sentence, with its reference, ‘as seith the bok,’ is
enough to indicate this, but a few more points may be mentioned here in
which the story of the _Pantheon_ differs from Gower and from the prose
_Historia Apollonii Tyrii_. (1) Godfrey of Viterbo does not say what
was the problem proposed by Antiochus, nor does he mention the period
of thirty days. (2) He gives no details of the flight of Apollonius or
of the mourning of his people, and he does not mention the incident of
Taliart (or Thaliarchus). (3) The name Pentapolim is not introduced.
(4) There is no mention in the _Pantheon_ of the wooing of the daughter
of Archistrates by three princes (or nobles) or of the bills which
they wrote. (5) There is no mention of the nurse Lichorida being taken
with Apollonius and his wife on shipboard, of the master of the ship
insisting that the corpse should be thrown into the sea, or of the name
of the physician, Cerimon. (6) The _Pantheon_ says nothing of the vow
of Apollonius in ll. 1301-1306. (7) The name Theophilus is not given.
(8) There is no mention of the tomb of Thaise (or Tharsia) being shown
to Apollonius. (9) In the _Pantheon_ the punishment of Strangulio and
Dionysia precedes the visit to Ephesus, and there is no mention of the
dream which caused Apollonius to sail to Ephesus.

There are indeed some points in which Gower agrees with the _Pantheon_
against the _Historia_, for example in making the princess ask for
Apollonius as her teacher on the very night of the banquet instead
of the next morning, and in representing that Apollonius went to his
kingdom after leaving his daughter at Tharsis (cp. E. Klebs, _Die
Erzählung von Apollonius aus Tyrus_, Berlin, 1899). Perhaps however
the most marked correspondence is where Gower makes the wife of
Apollonius ‘Abbesse’ of Diana’s temple (l. 1849), which is evidently
from Godfrey’s line, ‘Sic apud Ephesios velut abbatissa moratur’: cp.
also l. 1194 ‘warmed ofte.’ These are both among the later additions to
the _Pantheon_, and apparently were overlooked by Singer and Klebs when
they pronounced that Gower probably knew only the earlier redaction:
cp. notes on vii. 2765, 4181.

The Latin prose narrative has been printed in _Welseri Opera_, ed.
1682, pp. 681-704, and also in the Teubner series (ed. Riese, 1871,
1893). It is a translation from a Greek original, as is sufficiently
indicated by the Greek words that occur in it, and by the Greek customs
which it refers to or presupposes. Gower agrees with it pretty closely,
but the story is not improved in his hands. It loses, of course, the
Greek characteristics of which we have spoken, and several of the
incidents are related by Gower in a less effective manner than in
the original. For example, in the scene near the beginning between
Antiochus and Apollonius, the king asks, ‘Nosti nuptiarum conditionem?’
and the young man replies, ‘Novi et ad portam vidi,’ to which there is
nothing corresponding in Gower. Again, at a later stage of the story,
when the three young nobles send in their proposals to the daughter
of Archistrates, the original story makes her reply in a note which
declares that she will marry only ‘the ship-wrecked man.’ The king
innocently inquires of the three young men which of them has suffered
shipwreck, and finally hands the note to Apollonius to see if he can
make anything of it. This is much better managed than by Gower. On the
other hand our author has done well in dispensing with the rudeness and
boastfulness of Apollonius on the occasion when the king’s daughter
plays the harp at the feast, and also in modifying the scenes at
the brothel and excluding Athenagoras from taking part in them. The
quotations given in the following notes are made from the Bodleian MS.
Laud 247, a good copy of the twelfth century, which has a form of text
more nearly corresponding to that which Gower used than that of any
of the printed editions, and by means of which we can account for the
names Thaise and Philotenne.

It can hardly be necessary to observe that the play of _Pericles,
Prince of Tyre_, had another source besides Gower, and especially as
regards its fourth and fifth acts. Marina is waylaid while going to
visit the tomb of her old nurse, as in the original story, the scene
of the pirates agrees more nearly with the original than with Gower,
Lysimachus plays a part very like that which Gower took away from
Athenagoras, and the scene between Cleon and Dionyza (iv. 4) seems to
be suggested by the original. The story was current in English prose,
as is well known.

386. _And seileth_: cp. v. 3291 and note.

395. _he moste_, ‘that he might,’ ‘ut sibi liceret,’ a common use
of the word in older English (see examples in Bosworth and Toller’s
Dictionary).

405 ff. (margin). The riddle as given in the Laud MS. is, ‘Scelere
uehor. Materna carne uescor. Quero patrem meum matris mee uirum uxoris
mee filiam, nec inuenio.’ Most copies have ‘fratrem meum’ for ‘patrem
meum,’ but Gower agrees with the Laud MS. I do not attempt a solution
of it beyond that of Apollonius, which is, ‘Quod dixisti scelere uehor,
non es mentitus, ad te ipsum respice. Et quod dixisti materna carne
uescor, filiam tuam intuere.’

484. _the Stwes._ For the spelling cp. ‘Jwes,’ v. 1713, 1808.

536. This is by no means in accordance with the original. Antiochus
exclaims on hearing of the flight of Apollonius, ‘Fugere modo quidem
potest, effugere autem quandoque me minime poterit,’ and at once issues
an edict, ‘Quicunque mihi Apollonium contemptorem regni mei uiuum
adduxerit, quinquaginta talenta auri a me dabuntur ei: qui uero caput
eius mihi optulerit, talentorum c. receptor erit’ (f. 205 v^o), and he
causes search to be made after him both by land and sea. The change
made by Gower is not a happy one, for it takes away the motive for the
flight from Tarsus, where Apollonius heard of this proscription.

542 ff. In the original Apollonius meets ‘Hellanicus’ at once on
landing, and is informed by him of the proscription. He makes an offer
to Strangulio to sell his wheat at cost price to the citizens, if they
will conceal his presence among them. The money which he receives as
the price of the wheat is expended by him in public benefits to the
state, and the citizens set up a statue of him standing in a two-horse
chariot (biga), his right hand holding forth corn and his left foot
resting upon a bushel measure.

603. _ferketh_, ‘conveys,’ from OE. ‘fercian’: cp. Anglo-Saxon Chron.
1009, Hī fercodon ða scipo eft to Lundenne’ (quoted in Bosworth and
Toller’s Dictionary).

624. ‘But with cable and cord broken asunder ... the ship’ &c., past
participle absolute, as ii. 791, viii. 1830.

640. _forto mote To gete ayein._ Apparently this means ‘to wish to get
again,’ a meaning derived from the phrase ‘so mot I,’ &c., expressing
a wish. The infinitive is very unusual. For the gerund with ‘to’ which
follows it cp. ii. 510, vii. 437, where we have this construction with
‘mai,’ ‘mihte.’

679. The account in the original story is here considerably different.
Gower did not understand the Greek customs. ‘Et dum cogitaret unde
uite peteret auxilium, uidit puerum nudum per plateam currentem, oleo
unctum, precinctum sabana, ferentem ludos iuueniles ad gymnasium
pertinentes, maxima uoce dicentem: Audite ciues, audite peregrini,
liberi et ingenui, gymnasium patet. Apollonius hoc audito exuens
se tribunario ingreditur lauacrum, utitur liquore palladio; et dum
exercentes singulos intueretur, parem sibi querit et non inuenit.
Subito Arcestrates rex totius illius regionis cum turba famulorum
ingressus est: dumque cum suis ad pile lusum exerceretur, uolente deo
miscuit se Apollonius regi, et dum currenti sustulit pilam, subtili
ueiocitate percussam ludenti regi remisit’ &c. (f. 207 v^o).

The story proceeds to say that the king, pleased with the skill of
Apollonius in the game of ball, accepted his services at the bath, and
was rubbed down by him in a very pleasing manner. The result was an
invitation to supper.

Gower agrees here with the _Pantheon_ in making the king a spectator
only.

691. _Artestrathes._ The name is Arcestrates in the Laud MS.

706. _lefte it noght_, ‘did not neglect it.’

720 f. ‘Ingressus Apollonius in triclinium, contra regem adsignato loco
discubuit.’ Gower apparently sets him at the head of the second table.
For ‘beginne’ cp. _Cant. Tales_, Prol. 52, with Skeat’s note.

767 ff. In the original all applaud the performance of the king’s
daughter except Apollonius, who being asked by the king why he alone
kept silence, replied, ‘Bone rex, si permittis, dicam quod sentio:
filia enim tua in artem musicam incidit, nam non didicit. Denique iube
mihi tradi liram, et scies quod nescit’ (f. 208 v^o). Gower has toned
this down to courtesy.

782. ‘ita stetit ut omnes discumbentes una cum rege non Apollonium sed
Apollinem estimarent.’

866 ff. In the original this incident takes place when the king is
in company with Apollonius. The king replies that his daughter has
fallen ill from too much study, but he bids them each write his name
and the sum of money which he is prepared to offer as dowry, and he
sends the bills at once to the princess by the hand of Apollonius. She
reads them, and then asks whether he is not sorry that she is going
to be married. He says, ‘Immo gratulor,’ and she replies, ‘Si amares,
doleres.’ Then she writes a note, saying that she wishes to have ‘the
shipwrecked man’ as her husband, adding ‘Si miraris, pater, quod pudica
uirgo tam inprudenter scripserim, scitote quia quod pudore indicare non
potui, per ceram mandaui, que ruborem non habet.’ The king having read
the note asks the young men which of them has been shipwrecked. One
claims the distinction, but is promptly exposed by his companions, and
the king hands the note to Apollonius, saying that he can make nothing
of it. Apollonius reads and blushes, and the king asks, ‘Inuenisti
naufragum?’ To which he replies discreetly, ‘Bone rex, si permittis,
inueni.’ The king at last understood, and dismissed the three young
men, promising to send for them when they were wanted.

901 ff. ‘cui si me non tradideris, amittis filiam tuam,’ but this is
afterwards, in a personal interview.

930 ff. There is no mention of the queen in the original. The king
calls his friends together and announces the marriage. The description
of the wedding, &c., ll. 952-974, is due to Gower.

1003 ff. In the original story it is here announced to Apollonius that
he has been elected king in succession to Antiochus; but this was
regarded by our author as an unnecessary complication.

1037 ff. The details of the description are due to our author.

1054 ff. So far as the original can be understood, it seems to say that
the birth of the child was brought about by the storm and that the
appearance of death in the mother took place afterwards, owing to a
coagulation of the blood caused by the return of fair weather.

1059-1083. This is all Gower, except 1076 f.

1089 ff. Apparently the meaning is that the sea will necessarily cast
a dead body up on the shore, and therefore they must throw it out of
the ship, otherwise the ship itself will be cast ashore with it. The
Latin says only, ‘nauis mortuum non suffert: iube ergo corpus in pelago
mitti’ (f. 211 v^o).

1101. The punctuation is that of F.

1128. _tak in his mynde_, ‘let him take thought’: cp. v. 3573, and l.
1420 below.

1165. _the wisest_: cp. Introduction, p. cxi.

1184 ff. In the original it is not Cerimon himself, but a young
disciple of his, who discovers the signs of life and takes measures
for restoring her. She has already been laid upon the pyre, and he by
carefully lighting the four corners of it (cp. l. 1192) succeeds in
liquefying the coagulated blood. Then he takes her in and warms her
with wool steeped in hot oil.

1195. ‘began’ is singular, and the verbs ‘hete,’ ‘flacke,’ ‘bete’ are
used intransitively: ‘to flacke’ means to flutter.

1219. ‘In short, they speak of nothing’: ‘as for an ende’ seems to
mean the same as ‘for end’ or ‘for an end’ in later English: cp. _New
English Dictionary_, ‘end.’

1248. This daughter is apparently an invention of Gower’s, who perhaps
misread the original, ‘adhibitis amicis filiam sibi adoptauit,’ that
is, he adopted her as his daughter.

1285. _his In_, ‘his lodging,’ in this case the house of Strangulio.
Note the distinction made here by the capital letter between the
substantive and the adverb: see Introduction, p. clix.

1293. _whiche_: note the plural, referring to Strangulio and his wife.

1295. The name here in the original is ‘Tharsia,’ given to her by her
father’s suggestion from the name of the city, Tharsus, where she was
left; but the Laud MS. afterwards regularly calls her Thasia.

1311 ff. This is not in accordance with the Latin prose story. He is
there represented as telling Strangulio that he does not care, now that
he has lost his wife, either to accept the offered kingdom or to return
to his father-in-law, but intends to lead the life of a merchant. Here
the expression is ‘ignotas et longinquas petens Egypti regiones.’
On the other hand the _Pantheon_ makes him proceed to his kingdom,
apparently Antioch.

1337. _Philotenne_: the name in the Laud MS. is ‘Philothemia,’ but
it is not distinguishable in writing from Philothenna. There is much
variation as to this name in other copies.

1349 ff. Much is made in the original story of the death of this nurse
and of the revelation which she made to Tharsia of her real parentage.
Up to this time she had supposed herself to be the daughter of
Strangulio. The nurse suspected some evil, and advised Tharsia, if her
supposed parents dealt ill with her, to go and take hold of the statue
of her father in the market-place and appeal to the citizens for help.
After her death Tharsia visited her tomb by the sea-shore every day,
‘et ibi manes parentum suorum inuocabat.’ Here Theophilus lay in wait
for her by order of Dionysiades.

1374. _cherles._ This is the reading of the best copies of each
recension: cp. ‘lyves’ for ‘livissh’ i. e. living, ‘worldes’ for
‘worldly,’ ‘dethes’ for ‘dedly,’ iii. 2657, iv. 382, &c.

1376. _what sche scholde_, that is, what should become of her.

1391. _Scomerfare._ The first part of this word must be the French
‘escumerie,’ meaning piracy: see Du Cange under ‘escumator,’ e. g. ‘des
compaignons du pays de Bretaigne, qui étaient venuz d’Escumerie.’

1393. _and he to go_, that is, ‘and he proceeded to go,’ a kind of
historic infinitive: cp. Chaucer, _Troilus_, ii. 1108, ‘And she to
laughe,’ _Leg. of Good Women_, 653 ‘And al his folk to go.’ (In
_Piers Plowman_, A. Prol. 33, ‘And somme murthes to make,’ quoted
by Mätzner, it is more probable that ‘to make’ is dependent on
‘chosen.’) In addition to these instances we have the repeated use of
‘to ga’ in Barbour’s _Bruce_, e. g. viii. 251, ix. 263, which is much
more probably to be explained in this way than as a compound verb.
Cp. Skeat’s _Chaucer_, vol. vi. p. 403, with C. Stoffel’s note on
_Troilus_, ii. 1108, which is there quoted.

1410. The Laud MS. has ‘leno leoninus nomine,’ but many copies give no
name.

1420. _Lei doun_, ‘let him lay down’: cp. l. 1128.

1423. There is an interesting touch in the original here which would
not be intelligible to Gower. When Tharsia is led into the house, the
character of which she does not know, she is bidden to do reverence to
a statue of Priapus which stands in the entrance hall. She asks her
master whether he is a native of Lampsacus, and he explains to her that
his interest in this matter is not local but professional.

1424 ff. There is much in the original about the visit of Athenagoras
and of other persons, who are successively so far overcome by the tears
and entreaties of Tarsia, as not only to spare her but to give her
large sums of money, while at the same time they make a jest both of
themselves and of one another for doing so.

1451 f. The rhyme is saved from being an identical one by the adverbial
use of ‘weie’ in the second line, ‘mi weie’ being equivalent to ‘aweie.’

1513. In the original she is reproached by her husband for the deed,
and this is the case in the play of _Pericles_ also.

1518. _of record_, ‘of good repute.’

1534 f. Cp. _Pericles_, iv. 4, ‘The fairest, sweetest, best lies here,’
but the rest of the epitaph compares unfavourably with Gower’s.

1567 ff. Here we have a curious lapse on the part of our author.
He represents that the king had no sooner held his parliament and
celebrated the sacrifice in memory of his wife, than he began to
prepare for his voyage to Tharsis. The story requires however that
at least fourteen years should elapse, and this, according to the
original narrative, has been spent by Apollonius in travelling about
as a merchant, a matter of which Gower says nothing. Probably the
_Pantheon_, which is not very clear on the matter, is responsible for
the oversight.

1587. ‘For she is continually changing with regard to him.’

1617. _besihe_, ‘attended to.’ The use of this verb was not very
common in Gower’s time except in the participle ‘beseie,’ ‘besein.’
The verb means (1) look, see, (2) look to, attend to, (3) provide,
arrange: hence the participle is quite naturally used in the sense
of ‘furnished,’ ‘provided,’ and we have ‘unbesein of,’ l. 153, for
‘unprovided with.’ It is usually explained by reference to its first
sense, as having regard necessarily to appearance. ‘Appearing in
respect of dress, &c.,’ ‘Appearing as to accomplishments, furnished’
(so _New English Dictionary_), but it is more natural to take these
meanings of the participle as from senses (2) (3) of the verb. It
is doubtful whether even the phrase ‘well besein’ used of personal
appearance means anything but ‘well furnished.’

1636. _fordrive_, ‘driven about’ by storms, actually and metaphorically.

1670 ff. Her song is given in the original; it is rather pretty, but
very much corrupted in the manuscripts. It begins thus,

  ‘Per sordes gradior, sed sordis conscia non sum,
  Ut rosa in spinis nescit mucrone perire,’ &c.

1681 ff. Several of her riddles are given in the original story and he
succeeds in answering them all at once. One is this,

  ‘Longa feror uelox formose filia silue,
  Innumeris pariter comitum stipata cateruis:
  Curro uias multas, uestigia nulla relinquens.’

The answer is ‘Nauis.’

She finally falls on his neck and embraces him, upon which he kicks
her severely. She begins to lament, and incidentally lets him know her
story. The suggestion contained in ll. 1702 ff., of the mysterious
influence of kinship, is Gower’s own, and we find the same idea in the
tale of Constance, ii. 1381 f.,

  ‘This child he loveth kindely,
  And yit he wot no cause why.’

1830. ‘And all other business having been left’: cp. ii. 791.

1890. _With topseilcole_: cp. v. 3119,

  ‘Bot evene topseilcole it blew.’

The word ‘topseilcole’ (written as one word in the best copies of each
recension) does not seem to occur except in these two passages. It is
evidently a technical term of the sea, and in both these passages it is
used in connexion with a favourable wind. Morley quotes from Godefroy
a use of the word ‘cole’ in French in a nautical sense, ‘Se mistrent
en barges et alerent aux salandres, et en prisrent les xvii, et l’une
eschapa, qui estoit a la cole.’ Unfortunately, however, it is uncertain
what this means. The vessels in question were in port when they were
attacked, and therefore ‘a la cole’ might reasonably mean with sails
(or topsails) set, and so ready to start. A topsail breeze would be one
which was fairly strong, but not too strong to allow of sailing under
topsails, and this is rather the idea suggested by the two passages in
Gower.

It should be noted that in F and in some other MSS. there is a stop
after the word ‘topseilcole.’

1948. _forto honge and drawe_: the verbs are transitive, ‘that men
should hang and draw them’ (i. e. pluck out their bowels).

1983. This must mean apparently ‘They had no need to take in a reef.’
The use of ‘slake’ with this meaning does not seem quite appropriate,
but a sail or part of a sail is slackened in a certain sense when it is
taken in, seeing that it is no longer subject to the pressure of the
wind.

2055. _leng the lasse_: cp. iii. 71, ‘the leng the ferre.’ This form of
the comparative is usual in such phrases, as Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, A
3872, ‘That ilke fruit is ever leng the wers,’ and perhaps also E 687,
F 404, _Compl. unto Pite_, 95, where the MSS. gives ‘lenger.’ The form
‘leng’ is the original comparative adverb of ‘long.’

2077. _toward Venus_: cp. v. 6757. Here it means ‘on the side of Venus.’

2095. _sett_, imperative, like ‘set case,’ i. e. ‘suppose that.’ The
reading ‘sith’ is certainly wrong.

2113. _his oghne dom._ The word ‘dom’ is used here in special reference
to ‘kingdom’ in the line above. ‘Every man has a royal rule to
exercise, that is the rule over himself.’

2124 f. ‘When he has not kept possession for himself of his own heart.’

2165. _And felt it_: we have here the elision-apocope in the case of a
preterite subjunctive.

2194. _hath nothing set therby_, ‘accounted it as nothing.’

2198. _withholde_, ‘kept’ (in service).

2212 f. Cp. iii. 298, _Vox Clam._ ii. 1.

2217 ff. This ‘Supplication’ is a finished and successful composition
in its way, and it may make us desire that our author had written more
of the same kind. The poem _In Praise of Peace_, which is written in
the same metre and stanza, is too much on a political subject to give
scope for poetical fancy. The nearest parallel in style is to be found
in some of the author’s French Balades.

2245. _Whom nedeth help_, ‘He to whom help is needful’: cp. Prol. 800,
i. 2446.

2253 ff. Cp. vi. 330 ff.

2259 ff. Cp. _Balades_, xx.

2265. _Danger_: see note on i. 2443.

2288. Cp. i. 143 ff.

2312. _a Mile_: cp. iv. 689. It means apparently the time that it takes
to go a mile: cp. Chaucer, _Astrol._ i. 16, ‘five of these degres maken
a milewey and thre mileweie maken an houre.’

2319. _a game_, for ‘agame’: cp. Chaucer, _Troilus_, iii. 636, 648.
More usually ‘in game,’ as l. 2871.

2341. _fulofte hath pleigned_: as for example in the _Planctus Naturae_
of Alanus de Insulis.

2365. ‘And I will consider the matter’: practically equivalent to a
refusal of the petition, as in the form ‘Le Roy s’avisera.’

2367. _is noght to sieke_, ‘is not wanting’: cp. i. 924, ii. 44, &c.

2378. ‘In no security, but as men draw the chances of Ragman.’ To
understand this it is necessary to refer to compositions such as we
find in the Bodleian MSS., Fairfax 16, and Bodley 638, under the name
of ‘Ragman (or Ragmans) Rolle.’ The particular specimen contained in
these MSS. begins thus:

  ‘My ladyes and my maistresses echone,
  Lyke hit unto your humble wommanhede,
  Resave in gre of my sympill persone
  This rolle, which withouten any drede
  Kynge Ragman me bad [me] sowe in brede,
  And cristyned yt the merour of your chaunce.
  Drawith a strynge and that shal streight yow lede
  Unto the verry path of your governaunce.’

After two more stanzas about the uncertainty of Fortune and the
chances of drawing well or ill, there follows a disconnected series of
twenty-two more, each giving a description of the personal appearance
and character of a woman, in some cases complimentary and in others
very much the reverse, usually in the form of an address to the lady
herself, e. g.

  ‘A smal conceyt may ryght enogh suffyse
  Of your beaute discripcion for to make;
  For at on word ther kan no wyght devyse
  Oon that therof hath lasse, I undertake,’ &c.

Apparently these stanzas are to be drawn for and then read out in order
as they come, for the game ends with the last,

  ‘And sythen ye be so jocunde and so good,
  And in the rolle last as in wrytynge,
  I rede that this game ende in your hood.’

Evidently the same kind of game might be played by men with a view to
their mistresses. It is much the same thing as the ‘Chaunces of the
Dyse,’ where each stanza is connected with a certain throw made with
three dice: cp. note on iv. 2792. The name ‘Ragman Rolle’ seems to be
due to the disconnected character of the composition.

2407. _olde grisel_: cp. _Chaucer, To Scogan_, 35: ‘grisel’ means grey
horse.

2415. _upon the fet_, that is, when the time comes for action. The
rhyme with ‘retret’ shows that this is not the plural of ‘fot’:
moreover, that is elsewhere regularly spelt ‘feet’ by Gower.

2428. _sitte_ for ‘sit’: cp. Introduction, p. cxiv.

2435. _torned into was_: the verb used as a substantive, cp. vi. 923.

2450 ff. The situation here has some resemblance to that in the
Prologue of the _Legend of Good Women_, where the author has a vision
of the god of Love coming to him in a meadow, as he lies worshipping
the daisy, accompanied by queen Alcestis, and followed first by
the nineteen ladies of the Legend, and then by a vast multitude of
other women who had been true in love. The differences, however, are
considerable. Here we have Venus and Cupid, the latter armed with a bow
and blind (whereas Chaucer gives him two fiery darts and his eyesight),
with two companies of lovers, both men and women, marshalled by Youth
and Eld as leaders; and the colloquy with the poet has for its result
to dismiss him with wounds healed from Love’s service, as one who has
earned his discharge, while in the case of Chaucer it is a question
of imposing penance for transgressions in the past and of enlisting
him for the future as the servant of Love. The conception of the god
of Love appearing with a company of true lovers in attendance may be
regarded as the common property of the poets of the time, and so also
was the controversy between the flower and the leaf (l. 2468), which
Chaucer introduces as a thing familiar already to his readers. If our
author had any particular model before him, it may quite as well have
been the description in Froissart’s _Paradys d’Amours_ (ed. Scheler, i.
29 f.):

  ‘Lors regardai en une lande,
  Si vi une compagne grande
  De dames et de damoiselles
  Friches et jolies et belles,
  Et grant foison de damoiseaus
  Jolis et amoureus et beaus.

         *       *       *       *       *

  “Dame,” di je, “puis je sçavoir
  Qui sont ceuls que puis là veoir?”
  “Oil,” dit ma dame de pris;
  “Troïllus y est et Paris,
  Qui furent fil au roi Priant,
  Et cesti que tu vois riant,
  C’est Laiscelos tout pour certain,”’ &c.

and she proceeds to enumerate the rest, including Tristram and Yseult,
Percival, Galehaus, Meliador and Gawain, Helen, Hero, Polyxena, and
Medea with Jason.

I do not doubt that Gower may have seen the _Legend of Good Women_, but
it was not much his practice to borrow from contemporary poets of his
own country, however free he might make with the literature of former
times or of foreign lands.

2461. _who was who_: cp. vii. 2001.

2468. Cp. Chaucer, _Leg. of G. Women_, 72, 188, &c.

2470. _the newe guise of Beawme_, that is, the new fashions of dress,
&c., introduced from Bohemia by the marriage of Richard II in 1382.

2500 f. _which was believed With bele Ysolde_, ‘who was accepted as
a lover by Belle Isolde.’ Apparently ‘believed’ is here used in the
primary sense of the verb, from which we have ‘lief.’ For the use of
‘with’ cp. l. 2553. We may note here that the spelling ‘believe’ is
regular in Gower, ‘ie’ representing ‘̄ẹ.’

2502. _Galahot_, i. e. Galahalt, called by Mallory ‘the haut prince.’

2504 ff. It may be noted that several of the lovers in the company of
Youth are impenitent in their former faithlessness, as Jason, Hercules
and Theseus, while Medea, Deianira and Ariadne are left to complain by
themselves. Troilus has recovered Cressida, if only for a time. It is
hard to say why Pyramus failed of Thisbe’s company, unless indeed she
were unable to pardon his lateness (cp. 2582).

2515 ff. Cp. v. 7213 ff.

2553. _with Enee_: cp. vii. 3359 and l. 2501.

2573 ff. It is likely enough that this idea of Cleopatra’s death may
have been a reminiscence of the _Legend of Good Women_, 696 ff. Chaucer
apparently got it from some such account as that quoted by Vincent of
Beauvais from Hugh of Fleury, ‘in mausoleum odoribus refertum iuxta
suum se collocavit Antonium. Deinde admotis sibi serpentibus morte
sopita est.’ From this to the idea of a grave full of serpents would
not be a difficult step.

2582. _Wo worthe_: cp. l. 1334.

2663. I take ‘lay’ to mean ‘law,’ i. e. the arrangement of his company.

2687. Cp. iv. 2314.

2705 ff. An allusion to some such story as we have in the ‘Lay
d’Aristote’ (Méon et Barbazan, iii. p. 96).

2713. The punctuation follows F.

2714 ff. This refers to the well-known story of Virgil and the daughter
of the Emperor, who left him suspended in a box from her window.

2718. _Sortes._ It is impossible that this can be for ‘Socrates,’ with
whose name Gower was quite well acquainted. Perhaps it stands for the
well-known ‘Sortes Sanctorum’ (Virgilianae, &c.), personified here as a
magician, and even figuring, in company with Virgil and the rest, as an
elderly lover.

2799. Cp. i. 143 ff.

2823. _syhe_, subj., ‘should see.’

2828. _deface_: apparently intransitive, ‘suffer defacement’: cp. iv.
2844.

2833. _Outwith_, ‘outwardly’: so ‘inwith’ often for ‘within,’
‘inwardly.’ Dr. Murray refers me to _Orm._ i. 165, ‘utenn wiþþ,’ and
Hampole, _Prick of Conscience_, 6669, ‘outwith.’ The best MSS. have a
stop after ‘Outwith.’

2904. _A Peire of Bedes_: the usual expression for a rosary: cp. _Cant.
Tales_, Prol. 158 f.,

  ‘Of smal coral aboute hire arm she bar
  A peire of bedes gauded al with grene.’

2926 f. That is the _Speculum Hominis_ and the _Vox Clamantis_.

2931. _pernable._ The best MSS. have this, and it is obviously suitable
to the sense: ‘Do not pursue when the game cannot be caught.’ From
‘prendre’ Gower uses ‘pernons,’ ‘pernetz,’ &c., in the _Mirour_.

2938. At this point begins a new hand in F, and for the rest of this
leaf (f. 184) the text is written over an erasure (ll. 2938-2966). A
note is written opposite l. 2938 for the guidance of the scribe, ‘now
haue &c.’ It may be noted that l. 2940 has a coloured initial A as
for the beginning of a paragraph, and this apparently belongs to the
original writing, whereas in the first recension MSS. the paragraph
begins at l. 2941. The next leaf (f. 185) is a substituted one, and the
text is written still in the same hand.

The orthography of the new hand, in which ll. 2938-3146 are written,
differs in some respects from the standard spelling which we have in
the rest of the manuscript. The chief points of difference are as
follows:

(1) _-id_ (_-yd_) termination almost always in the past participle,
as _enclosid_, _turnyd_, _bewhapid_, _blessid_ (but _sterred_), _iþ_
frequently in the 3rd pers. sing. of verbs, _belongiþ_, _seruiþ_,
_causiþ_ (but _secheþ_, _suieþ_), and _-in_ (_-yn_) in 3rd pers. pl.,
as _takyn_, _sechin_, _hierin_, _schuldyn_ (also _to lokyn_). (2)
_-is_ (_-ys_) in the genit. sing, and in the plural of substantives,
as _londis_, _mannys_, _bedis_, _lawis_, _wordis_ (but _þinges_,
_myghtes_). (3) _-ir_ (_-yr_) termination, as _aftir_, _ouyr_, _wondir_
(but _siker_). (4) _y_ for _i_ (_I_) in many cases, especially as
the pronoun of the first person (once _I_), also _ys_ (sometimes),
_hym_, _wiþynne_. (5) _gh_ for _h_ in such words as _sigh_, _sighte_,
_myghte_, _knyghthode_. (6) _ou_ for _o_ in _nought_, _brought_,
_þoughte_, &c. (7) consonants doubled in _vppon_ and vowels in _maad_
(also _mad_), _book_, _goon_. (8) separation of words, as _in to_, _un
to_, _hym self_, _þer fore_, _þer vpon_, _wher of_, _wiþ outen_.

It may be observed that something of the same tendency is observable
at this point in the Stafford MS., but the differences appear in a
much less marked manner, and chiefly in the terminations _-id_, _-iþ_,
_-is_, _-ir_. S does not give _y_ for _I_, _ys_ for _is_, nor _myghte_,
_sigh_, _nought_, _oughte_, _vppon_, _þer fore_, &c.

2974 (margin). _orat pro statu regni._ This marks exactly the stage
reached in the second of the three versions which we have of Gower’s
account of his own works (p. 480,) ‘vbi pro statu regni compositor
deuocius exorat.’ The first completely excuses and the third utterly
condemns the king, but the second makes no mention of him either
for praise or blame, and that is the line taken in this form of the
epilogue.

3012. _maintenue_, that is, ‘maintenance’ of quarrels by the lords on
behalf of their followers: cp. _Mirour_, 23732 ff., where the same
subject is dealt with.

3081. _beth_: see Introd. p. cxiv: but it is the reading of F only.

3114. _curiosite_, ‘artful workmanship’: cp. Chaucer, _Compleinte of
Venus_, 81.

3147. Here, at the beginning of f. 186, the hand in F changes again and
the rest of the manuscript, including the _Traitié_, the Latin poems
and the author’s account of his books, is written in the hand which we
have in the first leaf of the Prologue.

     *       *       *       *       *

2955*. _his testament of love._ There is no reason to suppose that this
is a reference to any particular work which Gower may have known that
Chaucer had in hand. It may be a general suggestion that Chaucer should
before his death compose some further work on love, which should serve
as his last testimony (or last will and testament) on the subject, as
the shrift of the present poem was our author’s leave-taking. To assume
that the poem referred to must be the _Legend of Good Women_, and to
argue from this that the _Confessio Amantis_ was written before the
_Legend_ was given to the public, would be very rash. It is not likely
that Usk’s _Testament of Love_ was known to Gower when he wrote this.

2991*. This quality of mercy, for which Richard is especially praised,
seems to have been precisely the point in which he was afterwards
most found wanting by our author, so that he finally earns the title
of ‘crudelissimus rex.’ Matters had not gone so far as this when the
second form of epilogue was substituted, in which these praises were
simply omitted. Gower was then (in the fourteenth year of the reign) in
a state of suspended judgement, expressed by the ‘orat pro statu regni’
of 2974 (margin). The subsequent events, and especially the treatment
of the duke of Gloucester and his friends, finally decided his opinions
and his allegiance, as we may see in the _Cronica Tripertita_.

3054* ff. See Prol. 83* ff.

3102*. _no contretaile_, ‘no retribution’ afterwards: cp. _Traitié_,
vii. 3, ‘De son mesfait porta le contretaille.’

3104*. That is, it tends rather to set us free from evil consequences
than to bring them upon us.


EXPLICIT, 5 f. The following copies of the first recension contain
these last two lines, XERB₂Cath. Of the rest MH₁YGODAr.Ash. are
imperfect at the end, N₂ omits the Explicit altogether, and I have no
note as regards this point about Ad₂P₁Q. Of the seven which I note as
having the ‘Explicit’ in four lines only, three are of the revised
and four of the unrevised group. All copies of the second and third
recensions have the last two lines, except of course those that are
imperfect here.


QUAM CINXERE FRETA, &c. The ‘philosopher’ who was the author of this
epistle is no doubt responsible also for the lines ‘Eneidos, Bucolis,’
&c. (printed in the Roxb. ed. of the _Vox Clamantis_, p. 427), in
which our author is compared to Virgil, the chief difference being
that whereas Virgil had achieved fame in one language only, Gower had
distinguished himself in three. The writer in that case also is ‘quidam
philosophus’ (not ‘quidam Philippus,’ as he is called in the printed
copy), and I suspect that he was the ‘philosophical Strode’ who is
coupled with Gower in the dedication of _Troilus_.

3. ‘tibi’ belongs to the next line, ‘siue satirus Poeta’ being taken
together.


QUIA VNUSQUISQUE, &c. The form here given is found in no manuscript
of the _Confessio Amantis_ except F and H₂ (copied from F), though
some other third recension copies, as W and K, may probably have
contained it. We have it, however, also in two manuscripts of the _Vox
Clamantis_, the All Souls copy and that in the Hunterian Library at
Glasgow.

It should be noted that whereas the first recension manuscripts
regularly contain the Latin account of the author’s three books in
immediate connexion with the _Confessio Amantis_, in the second
recension it is made to follow the _Traitié_, and SΔ, which do not
contain the _Traitié_, omit this also, while in F it comes later still,
following the Latin _Carmen de multiplici viciorum pestilencia_.
Thus the form which we have in F must be regarded as later than
the accompanying text of the _Confessio Amantis_, from which it is
separated in the MS. both by position and handwriting, and the words
‘ab alto corruens in foueam quam fecit finaliter proiectus est’ seem to
indicate that it was written after the deposition of Richard II.

11 f. ‘Speculum hominis’ in all copies of the first recension.
‘Speculum meditantis’ over an erasure in the Glasgow MS. of the _Vox
Clamantis_.

25 ff. Note the omission here (of nine words which are necessary to
the sense) in every first recension copy except J. Similarly below
all except J have ‘finem’ for ‘sentencie,’ obviously from a mistaken
reading of a contraction (‘ſiē’). These must be original errors, only
removed by later revision, the first no doubt due to dropping a line.


IN PRAISE OF PEACE.

The text of this poem is taken from the manuscript at Trentham Hall
belonging to the Duke of Sutherland, which contains also the _Cinkante
Balades_. Of this book a full description has been given in the
Introduction to Gower’s French Works, pp. lxxix ff. The present poem is
the first piece in the book (ff. 5-10 v^o), and is written in the same
hand as the _Balades_ and _Traitié_, a hand which resembles that which
appears in ff. 184, 185 of the Fairfax MS., though I should hesitate to
say positively that it is the same. Evidently, however, the manuscript
is contemporary with the author, and it gives us an excellent text of
the poem. The date of its composition is doubtless the first year of
king Henry IV, for the manuscript which contains it ends with some
Latin lines (added in a different hand), in which the author speaks of
himself as having become blind in the first year of king Henry IV and
having entirely ceased to write in consequence of this.

As a composition it is not without some merit. The style is dignified,
and the author handles his verse in a craftsmanlike manner, combining
a straightforward simplicity of language with a smooth flow of metre
and a well-balanced stanza, the verse being preserved from monotony by
variety of pause and caesura. Some stanzas are really impressive, as
those which begin with ll. 99, 127, 148. The divisions of the poem,
indicated in the MS. by larger coloured initials, have hitherto escaped
the notice of editors.

The poem was printed first in the collected edition of _Chaucer’s
Works_, 1532, commonly called Thynne’s edition (ff. 375 v^{o}-378), and
reprinted from this in the succeeding folio editions of Chaucer (e. g.
1561, f. 330 v^{o}, 1598, f. 330 v^{o}, 1602, f. 314). There was no
attempt made in any of these to ascribe its authorship to Chaucer,
Gower’s name being always given as the author. It has been published
also by J. Wright in his _Political Poems and Songs_ (Rolls’ Series),
the text being taken from the Trentham MS., and it has been included
by Prof. Skeat in his interesting collection of poems which have been
printed with Chaucer’s works (_Chaucerian and other Pieces_, pp.
205-216).

Thynne followed a manuscript which gave a fair text, but one much
inferior to that of the Trentham copy, both in material correctness and
in spelling, e. g.

  ‘Kyng Salomon whiche had at his askyng
  Of god | what thyng him was leuest craue
  He chase wysedom vnto gouernyng
  Of goddes folke | the whiche he wolde saue
  And as he chase it fyl him for to haue
  For through his wytte while y^t his reigne last
  He gate him peace and rest in to his last’

All the material variations of Thynne are given in the critical notes,
but not his differences of spelling. Wright’s text is not to be trusted
as a reproduction of the Trentham MS. He made several serious mistakes
in copying from or collating it, and he has a good many trifling
inaccuracies of spelling. The following are his worst errors:

l. 3 _om._ this 16 the _for_ thi 71 To stere peace (_following Thynne_)
108 _om._ doth tofalle _for_ to falle 136 than _for_ that 173 But
aftirwards 202 _om._ worthi 211 any _for_ a 246 [good] _seeming to
imply that it is not in the MS._ 263 Which heliples 278 reserved _for_
deserved 289 man _for_ king 292 [up] 306 begete _for_ be gete 356
Resteined _for_ Resceived 363 deleated _for_ debated 382 sese _for_
see. In addition to these rather gross blunders, he has about a hundred
smaller deviations from the manuscript which he professes to follow,
as, for example, 7 for to _for_ forto (_and so afterwards_) 16 him self
_for_ himself (_and so afterwards_) 19 But 27 reqwest _for_ reqweste
39 might _for_ myht 56 shal _for_ schal 83 lefte _for_ left 84 not
_for_ noght 90 charitie _for_ charite 98 Both _for_ Bothe 102 gone
_for_ goon nygth _for_ nyght 110 dothe 112 I 120 Crists 155 fulfilled
172 wille 194 destruied 219 made 254 Ffirst chirche her silf 260 sick
280 life 287 made an end 319 found 355 Which 382 meschiefe and a good
many more. He also omits in a very misleading manner the last lines of
the rubric which follows the poem, ‘Et nunc sequitur epistola’ &c., as
well as the ‘epistle’ itself, ‘Rex celi deus’; and he makes it appear
that the lines ‘Henrici quarti’ &c. follow at once, whereas they are at
the end of the MS. and in a different hand.

I think it worth while to specify these instances because Wright’s
edition has been accepted by Prof. Skeat as an accurate reproduction of
a manuscript which is not generally accessible, and if no notice were
taken here of the readings given by Wright, it would still remain in
doubt whether he or I represented the text more correctly. Especially
in the cases where Wright has bracketed a word as not occurring in the
manuscript, it might be supposed that his positive testimony was to be
preferred.

Prof. Skeat has based his text on Thynne, making such alterations of
spelling as seemed to him suitable, and giving the variants of Wright’s
edition as those of the Trentham MS. Misled by Wright, he has accepted
in his text the readings ‘reserved’ in l. 278, and ‘cese’ in l. 382.

The text given by the Trentham MS. is apparently quite free from
material error, except as regards the word erased in l. 71, and the
points of spelling which require correction are very few in number.
The orthography is not quite in accordance with the standard spelling
of the Fairfax and Stafford MSS., and in some respects resembles that
of the third hand of F, on which we have commented in the note on
_Confessio Amantis_, viii. 2938. Here however there is only a slight
tendency to use _i_ for _e_ in weak terminations. We have _distourbid_
153, _vndefendid_: _amendid_ 223 f., _handlid_ 321, _soeffrin_ 222,
_folwiþ_ 23, _goddis_ 32, 84, _mannys_ 237, but elsewhere almost always
the usual forms, as _affermed_, _cared_, _gouerned_, _aken_, _ledeþ_,
_londes_, _mannes_. On the other hand the _-ir_ termination is used
almost regularly, as _vndir_, _wondir_, _aftir_, _modir_ (but _vnder_
286), and there is a tendency also to substitute _i_ for _e_ in other
places also, as _first_, _chirche_ (also _ferst_, _cherche_), _wirche_,
_dide_ (348), _proprite_, but _here_ for _hire_ 108, 329, cp. 254. For
_I_ (pers. pronoun) we have regularly _y_; _gh_ usually for _h_ in such
words as _right_, _myghti_, _knyght_, _light_, _highe_, _stigh_, but
also _riht_, _rihtwisnesse_, _knyht_; _vppon_ for _vpon_, _schulde_ but
also _scholde_. In addition to these points we may note the dropping
of _-e_ several times in _euer_, _neuer_, which hardly ever occurs in
the Fairfax MS., and also in _heuen_ 79, but we have also _euere_,
_neuere_, _heuene_. The _-e_ of the weak preterite form is dropped
before a vowel in _myht_ 39, _behight_ 41, _had_ 42, _mad_ 103, 345:
_-e_ is inserted in some imperatives, as _Leie_ 122, _sette_ 124,
_Lete_ 129, _putte_ 130, _þenke_ 162, _Beholde_ 276 (but _let_ 158,
_Kep_ 367, 384, _draugh_ 384). As regards the use of _þ_ and _ȝ_ the
Trentham MS. agrees with F.


There is no title in the manuscript, and Prof. Skeat calls the poem
‘The Praise of Peace,’ a title suggested by Mr. E. W. B. Nicholson.
I have adopted a modification of this, ‘To King Henry the Fourth in
Praise of Peace,’ expressing also the substance of that given by Thynne.

8 ff. The threefold claim of Henry IV is given in this stanza, as in
Chaucer’s well-known Envoy, but the ‘conquest’ is here represented as a
divine sanction.

50. _a place_, ‘into place’: cp. _Conf. Amantis_, v. 735, ‘Hou suche
goddes come aplace.’

53. _in manere_, ‘in due measure’: cp. _Conf. Amantis_, vii. 2132, 4344.

55. _what aftirward betide_, ‘whatever may happen afterwards.’

71. The first word of the line is erased in the manuscript, only the
initial S being left, with a space for five or six letters after it.
The word which is suggested in the text is perhaps as likely as any
other: for the form of it cp. ‘Maintene,’ l. 385. Thynne’s reading, ‘To
stere peace,’ looks like a lame attempt on the part of a copyist to
fill the gap.

78 ff. _Conf. Amantis_, iii. 2265 ff.

89. I write regularly ‘evere’ ‘nevere’ in accordance with Gower’s
practice: so 126, 127, 148, 241, 301, 350, 365.

90. _alle charite._ The MS. has ‘al charite,’ but the metre and the
grammatical usage both require ‘alle,’ as in l. 293 and elsewhere.

94. _wisemennes_: cp. ‘wisemen,’ _Conf. Amantis_, vii. 1792.

106 ff. Cp. _Conf. Amantis_, iii. 2273 ff.

113. _Conf. Amantis_, iii. 2294 f.

115. Cp. _Conf. Amantis_, Prol. 444.

121. ‘Whose faith thou hast partly to guide.’

122. I correct the imperative form ‘Leie,’ and also ‘sette’ 124, ‘Lete’
129, ‘putte’ 130, ‘thenke’ 162, ‘Beholde’ 276, as contrary to Gower’s
practice and in several cases disturbing the metre.

150. Strictly speaking, we ought to have the subjunctive, ‘undirstode,’
but the rhyme will not allow.

155. So Prol. 88 f.,

  ‘The hyhe god him hath proclamed
  Ful of knyhthode and alle grace.’

157 f. ‘Peace with honour’ was a favourite thought of Gower’s, ‘pax et
honor’ in the _Vox Clamantis_, vii. 1415.

174. ‘on earth peace, goodwill towards men.’

177 ff. ‘Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.’

204. _waited_, ‘attended to.’

235. _devised_, ‘divided’: cp. _Conf. Amantis_, ii. 3264.

236 ff. ‘nevertheless the law stands so reasonably established by man’s
wit, that they can stand firm without that’ (i. e. without the help of
the Church).

266. Cp. Prol. 795, ‘The comun ryht hath no felawe,’ that is, none to
take its part.

278 f. _deserved To him._ The reading is right. It means ‘earned by
service rendered to him’: cp. _Conf. Amantis_, iv. 3577, ‘Thogh I no
deth to the deserve.’

281 ff. For the nine worthies see Caxton’s Preface to Mallory’s _Morte
d’Arthur_.

295 f. The question of winning a ‘chase’ at tennis is not one which
is decided at once by the stroke that is made, but depends on later
developments.

330 f. Cp. _Conf. Amantis_, vii. 3161*.

337 ff. _Conf. Amantis_, ii. 3187 ff.

345. _at al_, ‘altogether.’

354. _the lieve of lothe_, ‘they who were now loved but had before been
hated’ (by God).

356. I read ‘weren’ for the metre. However the case may be with
Chaucer, there is no instance elsewhere in Gower of elision prevented
by caesura. The cases that have been quoted are all founded on
misreadings.

365 f. Cp. _Conf. Amantis_, viii. 2988*.

379. _of pes_, ‘with regard to peace.’

382. _see the werre_, that is, ‘look to the war’: cp. ll. 137, 144, 281
ff. The reading ‘sese’ was invented by Wright.


REX CELI DEUS, &c. This piece is to a great extent an adaptation of the
original version of _Vox Clamantis_, vi. cap. 18, as it stands in the
Digby MS. The first eight lines are identically the same. Then follows
in the _Vox Clamantis_,

  ‘Ipse meum iuuenem conseruet supplico Regem,’ &c.

Of the remainder, as we have it here, ll. 25 f., 31-33, 36-39, 41 f.,
45-48 correspond with slight variations to lines in the _Vox Clamantis_
version, but the arrangement of them is different.

10. _Te que tuum regnum_, ‘Thee and thy kingdom,’ a quite common
position of ‘que’ in Gower’s Latin. So below, ll. 49, 50, 53, and often
elsewhere.

35. So also _Conf. Amantis_, vii, _after_ l. 1984.




GLOSSARY

AND

INDEX OF PROPER NAMES


The general resemblance between Gower and Chaucer in the matter of
language makes a comparison of their English vocabularies almost a
matter of course. Chaucer’s word-list is naturally much more extensive
than Gower’s, not only on account of the superior genius of the writer,
but also because of the greater extent and variety of his work,
Gower’s English work being less than half of Chaucer’s in amount, and
consisting of verse only, while nearly a fourth part of Chaucer’s is
prose. We find, however, that Gower has more than six hundred words
which are not used by Chaucer. Most of these are comparatively new
formations from French or Latin, but there is also among them a fair
sprinkling of old-established English words, some of which no doubt
were falling into disuse. Such words are, for example: adryh, aghte,
anele, arecche, areche, arere _v._, beȝete, bysne, eldemoder, enderday,
ferke, forȝifte, forlie, forworþe, frede, ȝeme, gladschipe, goodschipe,
grede (gradde), griþ, heveneriche, kingesriche, lere (= loss), lich
(= corpse), metrede, miele, mone (3), mull, orf, orped, rowe _v._ (=
dawn), sawht, skiere, spire _v._, spousebreche, þarmes, tome _s._,
tote, tyh (_pret._), tyt _adv._, wow, yhte.

Of the rest the following (among others) are words for which no
authority earlier than Gower is cited in the _New English Dictionary_
(A-I): those for which Gower is the sole authority are printed in
italics.

abeche, _ablaste_, abord, abroche _adv._, accidence, _agrope_,
altemetrie, _apostazied_, apparantie, approbacion, artificier,
aspirement, assignement, _assobre_, assote _v._, astraied, attempte
_v._, _attitled_, avant _adv._, _avantance_, babe, baldemoine, balke
_v._, baske, bass _adj._ (‘base’), bedawe, bederke, befole (‘befool’),
belwinge, _bethrowe_, _bewympled_, bienvenue, bombard, brothell,
_brygantaille_, calculacion, _caliphe_, carte (= writing), chacable,
chace (at tennis), chance _v._, chevance, circumference, client,
_coise_, cokard, cokerie (‘cookery’), compense, conclave, concordable,
congelacion, congruite, contempt, contourbe, courbe _s._ and _adj._,
decas, deificacion, delaiement, delate (= dilate), depos _s._,
_desclos_ _adj._, desclose _v._, desobeie, desobeissance, dispers,
distillacion, _doubtif_, drunkeschipe, _duistre_, effeminat _adj._,
eloquent, enbrouderie (‘embroidery’), enclin, encluyed, encourtined,
enfile, enheritance, _ensamplerie_, entendable, entendance, entendant,
epitaphe, esmaie, espeir, espleit (‘exploit’), exalacion, excessif,
excitacioun, _excusement_, expectant, faie _adj._, fieverous,
fixacioun, flacke, folhaste, folhastif, forcacche, forge _s._,
_forstormed_, forsueie, forthrere (= furtherer), froise, gaignage,
gamme, genitals, godward, gule, hepe (= hook), heraldie, hovedance,
injustice, interruption, intersticion, inthronize.

Of these nearly half are used in the English of the present day.

For the remainder of the alphabet I content myself with calling
attention to the following, without venturing on any statement about
their earlier use:

justificacion, liberal, liberalite, lien (= bond), lugge, mathematique,
matrone, mechanique, mecherie, menable, mineral, moevement, multitude,
oblivion, obstinacie, occupacion, original, passible, perjurie,
philliberd (= filbert), piereles, pilage, pleintif _adj._, pointure,
porte (= porthole), preparacion, presage, preserve, proclame,
prophetesse, providence, purefie, raile _s._, recepcion, recreacion,
relacion, renounce, reptil, resemblance, restauratif, revelen, riff
(= reef of a sail), sale, salvage, scharnebud, scisme, sculpture,
seintefic, solucion, specifie, sprantlen, spume, stacion, studious,
substitucion, supplante, supporte, temprure, tenetz (= tennis),
terremote, tonsure, transpose, trompette.

In matters of vocabulary my obligations are first and principally to
the _New English Dictionary_, then to Prof. Skeat’s Chaucer Glossary,
to Stratmann’s _Middle Engl. Dictionary_ (ed. Bradley), and to
Halliwell’s _Dictionary of Archaisms_. With reference especially to
Gower I may mention the dissertation by G. Tiete (Breslau, 1889).


The following Glossary is meant to include all the words used in
Gower’s English Works, with their various forms of spelling and (where
necessary) of inflexion, accompanied with such references as are
required for verification of the forms given and for illustration of
the different uses and meanings of the words. As a rule, when a word
occurs more than once, at least two references are given, but this
statement does not apply to inflexional forms. If a word presents
any difficulty or is used in a variety of meanings, the number of
references is proportionally increased. A complete set of references is
given for proper names.

The _Confessio Amantis_ is referred to by P., i, ii, iii, &c., P.
standing for the Prologue, and the Roman numerals for the successive
books. PP. stands for the poem _In Praise of Peace_. Word-forms which
are not found in the Fairfax MS., or only in the latter part of it,
which is written by a different hand, are sometimes enclosed in
parentheses. These are also used occasionally to indicate variation
of spelling: thus =dissencioun (-on)= means that the word is spelt
either with ‘-oun’ or ‘-on’ termination, =wher(e)= indicates that
‘wher’ and ‘where’ are alternative forms. In all cases where ‘y’ is
used to represent ‘ȝ,’ that fact is indicated by ‘(ȝ)’ placed after the
word when it occurs in its place, as =beyete (ȝ)=

The grammatical abbreviations are, _s._ substantive, _a._ adjective,
_v._ verb, _v.a._ verb active, _v.n._ verb neuter, _v.a.n._ verb active
and neuter, _3 s.pres._ 3rd person singular present tense, _pret._ past
tense, _pp._ past participle, _def._ definite form of adjective, &c.

In many cases an explanation is given of the meaning of words for the
convenience of readers, but no discussion as to their meaning or origin
is admitted in the Glossary.
